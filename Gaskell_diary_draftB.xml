               is so hard a word to apply to one so<lb/> dear. But in general she is so good<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="#Marianne_Holland">Marianne</persName> is now becoming every day<lb/>
               more and more interesting. She looks at<lb/> and tries to take hold of every thing.
               She<lb/> has pretty good ideas of distance and does<lb/> not try to catch sunbeams
               now, as she<lb/><pb n="4"/> did two months ago. Her sense of sight<lb/> is much
               improved lately in seeing objects<lb/> at a distance, and distinguishing them.<lb/>
               For instance I had her in my arms
               today<!-- necessary to code the slight diagonal downward on the "day" here?--><lb/>
               in the drawing room, and her <persName ref="#William_Gaskell">Papa</persName><lb/>
               was going out of the gate; and she evi<!--split word--><lb/>=dently knows him; smiled
               and kicked.<lb/> She begins to show a decided preference<lb/> to those she likes; she
               puts out her little<lb/> arms to come to me, and would I<lb/> am sure, do so to her
                  <persName ref="#William_Gaskell">Papa</persName>. She catches<lb/> the expression
               of a countenance to which she is accustomed directly;<lb/> when we laugh, she laughs;
               and when<lb/> I look attentive to <persName ref="#William_Gaskell"
               >William</persName><!--Create xml:id for William Gaskell-->'s reading,<lb/> it is
               quite ridiculous to see her little face of gravity, and earnestness, as if<lb/> she
               understood every word. I try always<lb/> to let her look at any thing which
               at<!--split word--><lb/>tracts her notice as long as she
                  <unclear>will</unclear><lb/><pb n="5"/> and when I see her looking very
               intently<lb/> at <choice>
                  <sic>any thing</sic>
                  <reg>anything</reg>
               </choice>, I take her to it, and let<lb/> her exercise all her senses upon
               it-<!-- place spaces around dashes or leave words connected?-->even<lb/> to tasting,
               if I am sure it can do her<lb/> no harm. My object is to give her a<lb/> habit of
               fixing her attention.<lb/></p>
            <p>She takes great delight in motion just<lb/> at present; dancing, jumping,
               shutting<lb/> and opening the hand pleases her very
               much:<!-- long gap. Not sure whether to code this as a paragraph break or an empty space-->
               I had no idea children<lb/> at her age, made such continued<lb/> noises; she shouts,
               and murmurs, and<lb/> talks in her way, just like conversa=<lb/><!--split word-->
               tion, varying her tones &amp;c. I wish<lb/> we could know what is passing<lb/> in her
               little mind. She likes any<lb/><!--split word-->=thing like singing, but seems
               afraid<lb/> of the piano; today she even began<lb/> to cray, when I began to
                  play.<lb/><pb n="6"/></p>
            <p>In general, I think she is remarkably<lb/> free from fear or shyness of any
               sort.<lb/> She goes to <choice>
                  <sic>any one</sic>
                  <reg>anyone</reg>
               </choice> who will take her,<lb/> staring at strangers to be sure, and being<lb/>
               very grave while they are in the room,<lb/> but not crying, or clinging to me. I
               am<lb/> very glad of this, as though is is very<lb/> flttering and endearing to me,
               yet<lb/> I should be sorry if she were to get the<lb/> habit of refusing to go to
               others.<lb/></p>
            <p>Then as to her "bodily" qualifications.<lb/> She has had two teeth cut with very
               little<lb/> trouble; but I believe the worst are<lb/> to come. She is very strong in
               her<lb/> limbs, though because she is so fat, we<lb/> do not let her use her <choice>
                  <sic>ancles</sic>
                  <reg>ankles</reg>
               </choice> at all,<lb/> and I hope she will be rather late in<lb/> walking that her
               little legs may be<lb/> very firm. I shall find it difficult to<lb/> damp the
               energies of the servants in<lb/> this respect, but I intend that she shall<lb/> teach
               herself to walk, &amp; receive no assist<lb/><pb n="7"
               /><!--photo blocks the equal sign used to mark split word or there is none here-->ance
               from hands &amp;c. She lies down on the<lb/> floor a good deal, and kicks about;
               a<lb/> practice I began very early, and which<lb/> has done her a great deal of
               good.<lb/></p>
            <p>She goes to bed <hi rend="underline">awake</hi>; another practice<lb/> I began early,
               and which is so comfort<lb/><!--split word-->=able I wonder it is not more
               generally<lb/> adopted. Once or twice we have had<lb/> grand cryings, which have been
               very<lb/> very distressing to me; but when I<lb/> have convinced myself that she is
               not<lb/> in pain, is perfectly well, and that she<lb/> is only wanting to be taken
               up<!-- possibly a dash between: taken-up. Consult a better image--> I have<lb/> been
               quite firm, though I have some=<lb/>=times<!--split word--> cried almost as much as
               she<lb/> has. I never leave her <sic>till</sic> she is as=<lb/><!--split word-->=leep
               (except in extreme cases) and as<lb/> she is put to bed at a regular time<lb/> (6
               o'clock) she generally gets very sleepy<lb/><pb n="8"/> while being undressed. While
               the un=<lb/><!--split word-->=dre&#383;sing is going on, I never like
               her<lb/> to be talked to, played with, or excited<lb/> yet sometimes she is so very
               playful<lb/> when she ought to be put down, that<lb/> a turn or two up and down the
               room<lb/> is required to soothe her, still putting<lb/> her down awake. Sometimes she
               will<lb/> cry a little, and when I turn her over<lb/> in her cot she fancies she is
               going<lb/> to be taken up and is still in a moment<lb/> making the peculiar little
               triumphing<lb/> noise she always does when she is<lb/> pleased.<lb/></p>
            <p>Crying has been a great difficulty<lb/> with me. Books do so differ. One says<lb/>
               "Do not let them have <choice>
                  <sic>any thing</sic>
                  <reg>anything</reg>
               </choice> they<lb/> cry for", another (<persName ref="Madame_deSaussure">M<hi

               ought, I still think it a<lb/> good one. We must consider that a<lb/> cry is a
               child's only language for<lb/> expressing its wants. It is its little way<lb/> of
               saying, "I am hungry, I am very<lb/> cold," and <hi rend="underline">so</hi>, I don't
               think we should<lb/> carry out the maxim of never letting<lb/> a child have <choice>

                  <reg>anything</reg>

                  But<lb/><pb n="10"/> if it is improper for it to obtain the<lb/> object, I think
               it right to withhold it<lb/> steadily, however much the little creature<lb/> may cry.
               I think after one or two
               attempts<!-- text diagonals down the page here for a couple letters. Mark?--><lb/> to
               conquer by crying the child would

            <p>I see it is exactly two months since I<lb/> last wrote in this book, and I hope<lb/> my little girl is improved both in<lb/> "body &amp; mind" since then. She suffers<lb/> a good deal from the changes of wea=<lb/><!--split word-->=ther we have had, and I have found<lb/> it nece&#383;sary to leave off milk as an<lb/> article of diet at present. She lives on<lb/> broth thickened with arrowroot, &amp;<lb/> I think this food strengthens her, but<lb/> she is still a delicate child, and back<lb/><!--split word-->ward in walking. I hope she will<lb/> not be hurried by any one in her<lb/> attempts at trotting about, for the more<lb/> I see and hear of children the more<lb/> I am convinced that when they<lb/> feel their limbs strong enough to<lb/> begin to walk they will constantly be trying their powers, &amp; that till<lb/><pb n="20"/> nature prompts this, it is worse than<lb/> usele&#383;s to force them to their feet.<lb/></p>
            <p>She is I believe a small child of her<lb/> age, though tall, and she has looked<lb/> (&amp; been too, alas!) very delicate since<lb/> that sad, sad illne&#383;s in the summer.<lb/> I am going to clothe her in flannel<lb/> waistcoats, and long sleeves to her frocks<lb/> this winter, and to keep her in <hi rend="underline">well-<!--word across line--><lb/> -aired</hi> rooms in preference to going<lb/> much out of doors unle&#383;s the weather<lb/> is very tempting. She has now had<lb/> eight teeth for some time, and is<lb/> about some more I fancy; perhaps<lb/> when her teeth are all through her<lb/> health may be stronger. Oh may I<lb/> try not to fasten &amp; <choice><sic>centre</sic><reg>center</reg></choice> my affections<lb/> too strongly on such a frail little<lb/> treasure, but all my anxiety though<lb/> it renders me so aware of her fragility<lb/> of life makes me cling daily more &amp;<lb/> more to her. </p><pb n="21"/><p>I think her disposition has im<lb/><!--word breaks over lines-->proved since I wrote last; she is<lb/> not so impatient (perhaps it was<lb/> the remains of her former illne&#383;s.)<lb/> she does not throw herself back in<lb/> the pa&#383;sionate way way she used to do<lb/> seven or eight weeks ago, and she<lb/> bears her little disappointments better.<lb/> The fewer she can have of these, &amp; the better<lb/> I think, and I try to avoid exci<!--word breaks across line--><lb/>ting her expectations, even when they<lb/> are pretty certain of being gratified,<lb/> for the excitement (which is always<lb/> so great in a child) is injurious, &amp;<lb/> produces a degree of impatience.<lb/> There are &amp; always will be <choice><sic>enow</sic><reg>enough</reg></choice> of disap<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>pointments to enure a child to bearng<lb/> them, and they will encrease with<lb/> years and with the power of enduring,<lb/> &amp; what I mean to say is that all that<lb/><pb n="22"/> can be averted by a little fore-thought<lb/> on the part of the parent or nurse, with<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>out interfering with the nece&#383;sary degree<lb/> of quiet but resolute discipline, should<lb/> be attended to and removed.

            <p>This morning we heard a sermon from <lb/>the text "And his mother kept all these <lb/>sayings in her heart." Oh! how very, very <lb/>true it is - and I sometimes think I may <lb/>find this little <!--insert reference to journal itself, some sort of listbibl?-->journal a great help in <lb/>recalling the memory o f my darling child, <lb/>if we should lose her.</p><p><lb/>We have had much cause for thankfulne&#383;s <lb/>since I wrote last; she has daily improved <lb/>in health, and I think her character has <lb/>developed itself a good deal latterly, and <lb/>promises to be amiable &amp; affectionate.</p><p><lb/>I see I have generally begun my journal <lb/>with describing the bodily progress she <lb/>has made, and I will keep to the <lb/>proper order of things.</p><pb n="35"/><p><lb/>She can manage to walk by herself <lb/>with the a&#383;sistance of chairs, the sofa &amp;c <lb/>and the natural consequence of this <unclear><gap unit="word" quantity="1"></gap></unclear> <lb/>exercise of the muscles of her legs, is that <lb/>they have become more developed &amp; conse=<lb/>=quently stronger; indeed her whole body <lb/>bespeaks her a more healthy child. There <lb/>is that mottled look on the flesh, which <lb/>gives such joy to a <!--flag this-->Mother's eye. She has <lb/>eight single, and four double teeth, and <lb/>suffers <hi rend="underline">comparatively</hi> little when she cuts <lb/>them. There is lo&#383;s of spirits &amp; appetite, <lb/>but no fits, or even fever, and spirits &amp; <lb/>appetite come back, &amp; bring their atten=<lb/>=dant good-humour when the cause <lb/>is removed. She has a colour like a <lb/>cherry, instead of the shlushed wavering <lb/>red it used to be; and certainly with <lb/>health, beauty has come; and I confe&#383;s <lb/>I think beauty a desirable thing. True <pb n="36"/><lb/>like most other gifts, it has its tempta=<lb/>=tions, but still it is a high gift in the <lb/>influence it irresistably gives its po&#383;se&#383;sor <lb/>over others- an influence which may be <lb/>used for such noble purposes.</p><p><lb/>In general she is very sweet-tempered; <lb/>true there are little bursts of pa&#383;sion <lb/>which will require watchfulne&#383;s &amp; care, <lb/>but she soon <gap unit="character" quantity="1" reason="squiggles"></gap> puts up her finger, and <lb/>says "hush" &amp; offers to ki&#383;s the person she <lb/>has offended against. Another more <lb/>difficult <hi rend="underline">fault</hi>? is her disobedience- <lb/> She does not seem at present to have <lb/>an idea of obedience; she is very obliging <lb/>and will often do the thing we desire <lb/>her to do, but sometimes she resists very <lb/>merrily &amp; in good-temper - puzzling <lb/>me sadly as to the right course to take. <lb/>For instance when she comes near a great gap between two chairs, I call to <lb/>her to come back to <persName ref="#MrsGaskell">Mama</persName>; she laughs<pb n="37"/><lb/>and still goes on; in gerenal I get up <lb/>and take her up, &amp; let her down at her <lb/>starting point, where she begins again, quite <lb/>good-tempered. Once or twice I have let <lb/>her go on, &amp; she has had a slight tumble <lb/>which I have tried to tell her was in <lb/>consequence of disobeying Mama- <lb/>She is very affectionate; when I am poorly, or whenever she thinks <sic>any one</sic> <lb/>is hurt or sorry, she strokes their face, <lb/>saying "poor <persName ref="#MrsGaskell">Mama</persName>, poor <persName ref="#WmGaskell">Papa</persName> &amp;c"- <lb/>Her qreat delight just now is in make-<lb/>believe letters; reading her own from <lb/><persName ref="#Hannah-Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>, and introducing the names <lb/>of all the things she knows, such as<lb/>"flowers, geese &amp;c. <choice><supplied resp="#mjk">"</supplied></choice> This and pictures <lb/>delight her extremely, but certainly <lb/>she is not so independent as she should <lb/>be, and as I intended her to be. She <lb/>has not much idea of amusing herself<pb n="38"/><lb/>which has been a great error in her edu=<lb/>=cation hitherto, probably arising from her <lb/>delicacy in part.</p><!--unsure whether this is a true pragraph break - there is an unusual gap in the center of a line--><p><lb/>She is remar=<lb/>=kably fond of children, and I am glad <lb/>to give her an <choice><reg>oppy</reg><supplied>opportunity</supplied></choice> of gratifying this <lb/>fondne&#383;s by taking her this week to stay <lb/>a day or two at <persName ref="#Mrs.Collins">Mrs. Collins</persName>, who has a <lb/>little girl five or six months younger <lb/>than <persName ref="#MAGaskell">Marianne</persName>. She seems to have <lb/>a good memory, and good natural <lb/>talents; I hope they may never be neglected <lb/>through me.</p><p><lb/>Lord thou knowest that the "sin that doth <lb/>so easily beset me" hath overtaken me <lb/>once or twice even with this dear child- <lb/>but thou knowest too how bitterly I have <lb/>repented, and how earnestly I mean to <lb/>try for the future. Help thou my weak=<lb/>=ne&#383;s, oh Lord, and ble&#383;s my endeavours to <lb/>conquer myself, and oh above all things <lb/>may her presence be as holy to me, <lb/>checking each angry word that might <pb n="39"/><lb/> injure the precious soul which thou hast <lb/>given to this little child. Ble&#383;s her, and ble&#383;s <lb/>her mother, who in sorrow confe&#383;ses her fault <lb/>and prays for thy guidance in her future <lb/>conduct. Oh Lord God Almighty ble&#383;s my <lb/>child, as thou seest fit &amp; best for her, <lb/>but may she hear the glad words when <lb/>her mortal life is done, "Well come good <lb/>&amp; faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." </p>
