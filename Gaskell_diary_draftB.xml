               is so hard a word to apply to one so<lb/> dear. But in general she is so good<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="#Marianne_Holland">Marianne</persName> is now becoming every day<lb/>
               more and more interesting. She looks at<lb/> and tries to take hold of every thing.
               She<lb/> has pretty good ideas of distance and does<lb/> not try to catch sunbeams
               now, as she<lb/><pb n="4"/> did two months ago. Her sense of sight<lb/> is much
               improved lately in seeing objects<lb/> at a distance, and distinguishing them.<lb/>
               For instance I had her in my arms
               today<!-- necessary to code the slight diagonal downward on the "day" here?--><lb/>
               in the drawing room, and her <persName ref="#William_Gaskell">Papa</persName><lb/>
               was going out of the gate; and she evi<!--split word--><lb/>=dently knows him; smiled
               and kicked.<lb/> She begins to show a decided preference<lb/> to those she likes; she
               puts out her little<lb/> arms to come to me, and would I<lb/> am sure, do so to her
                  <persName ref="#William_Gaskell">Papa</persName>. She catches<lb/> the expression
               of a countenance to which she is accustomed directly;<lb/> when we laugh, she laughs;
               and when<lb/> I look attentive to <persName ref="#William_Gaskell"
               >William</persName><!--Create xml:id for William Gaskell-->'s reading,<lb/> it is
               quite ridiculous to see her little face of gravity, and earnestness, as if<lb/> she
               understood every word. I try always<lb/> to let her look at any thing which
               at<!--split word--><lb/>tracts her notice as long as she
                  <unclear>will</unclear><lb/><pb n="5"/> and when I see her looking very
               intently<lb/> at <choice>
                  <sic>any thing</sic>
                  <reg>anything</reg>
               </choice>, I take her to it, and let<lb/> her exercise all her senses upon
               it-<!-- place spaces around dashes or leave words connected?-->even<lb/> to tasting,
               if I am sure it can do her<lb/> no harm. My object is to give her a<lb/> habit of
               fixing her attention.<lb/></p>
            <p>She takes great delight in motion just<lb/> at present; dancing, jumping,
               shutting<lb/> and opening the hand pleases her very
               much:<!-- long gap. Not sure whether to code this as a paragraph break or an empty space-->
               I had no idea children<lb/> at her age, made such continued<lb/> noises; she shouts,
               and murmurs, and<lb/> talks in her way, just like conversa=<lb/><!--split word-->
               tion, varying her tones &amp;c. I wish<lb/> we could know what is passing<lb/> in her
               little mind. She likes any<lb/><!--split word-->=thing like singing, but seems
               afraid<lb/> of the piano; today she even began<lb/> to cray, when I began to
                  play.<lb/><pb n="6"/></p>
            <p>In general, I think she is remarkably<lb/> free from fear or shyness of any
               sort.<lb/> She goes to <choice>
                  <sic>any one</sic>
                  <reg>anyone</reg>
               </choice> who will take her,<lb/> staring at strangers to be sure, and being<lb/>
               very grave while they are in the room,<lb/> but not crying, or clinging to me. I
               am<lb/> very glad of this, as though is is very<lb/> flttering and endearing to me,
               yet<lb/> I should be sorry if she were to get the<lb/> habit of refusing to go to
               others.<lb/></p>
            <p>Then as to her "bodily" qualifications.<lb/> She has had two teeth cut with very
               little<lb/> trouble; but I believe the worst are<lb/> to come. She is very strong in
               her<lb/> limbs, though because she is so fat, we<lb/> do not let her use her <choice>
                  <sic>ancles</sic>
                  <reg>ankles</reg>
               </choice> at all,<lb/> and I hope she will be rather late in<lb/> walking that her
               little legs may be<lb/> very firm. I shall find it difficult to<lb/> damp the
               energies of the servants in<lb/> this respect, but I intend that she shall<lb/> teach
               herself to walk, &amp; receive no assist<lb/><pb n="7"
               /><!--photo blocks the equal sign used to mark split word or there is none here-->ance
               from hands &amp;c. She lies down on the<lb/> floor a good deal, and kicks about;
               a<lb/> practice I began very early, and which<lb/> has done her a great deal of
               good.<lb/></p>
            <p>She goes to bed <hi rend="underline">awake</hi>; another practice<lb/> I began early,
               and which is so comfort<lb/><!--split word-->=able I wonder it is not more
               generally<lb/> adopted. Once or twice we have had<lb/> grand cryings, which have been
               very<lb/> very distressing to me; but when I<lb/> have convinced myself that she is
               not<lb/> in pain, is perfectly well, and that she<lb/> is only wanting to be taken
               up<!-- possibly a dash between: taken-up. Consult a better image--> I have<lb/> been
               quite firm, though I have some=<lb/>=times<!--split word--> cried almost as much as
               she<lb/> has. I never leave her <sic>till</sic> she is as=<lb/><!--split word-->=leep
               (except in extreme cases) and as<lb/> she is put to bed at a regular time<lb/> (6
               o'clock) she generally gets very sleepy<lb/><pb n="8"/> while being undressed. While
               the un=<lb/><!--split word-->=dre&#383;sing is going on, I never like
               her<lb/> to be talked to, played with, or excited<lb/> yet sometimes she is so very
               playful<lb/> when she ought to be put down, that<lb/> a turn or two up and down the
               room<lb/> is required to soothe her, still putting<lb/> her down awake. Sometimes she
               will<lb/> cry a little, and when I turn her over<lb/> in her cot she fancies she is
               going<lb/> to be taken up and is still in a moment<lb/> making the peculiar little
               triumphing<lb/> noise she always does when she is<lb/> pleased.<lb/></p>
            <p>Crying has been a great difficulty<lb/> with me. Books do so differ. One says<lb/>
               "Do not let them have <choice>
                  <sic>any thing</sic>
                  <reg>anything</reg>
               </choice> they<lb/> cry for", another (<persName ref="Madame_deSaussure">M<hi

               ought, I still think it a<lb/> good one. We must consider that a<lb/> cry is a
               child's only language for<lb/> expressing its wants. It is its little way<lb/> of
               saying, "I am hungry, I am very<lb/> cold," and <hi rend="underline">so</hi>, I don't
               think we should<lb/> carry out the maxim of never letting<lb/> a child have <choice>

                  <reg>anything</reg>

                  But<lb/><pb n="10"/> if it is improper for it to obtain the<lb/> object, I think
               it right to withhold it<lb/> steadily, however much the little creature<lb/> may cry.
               I think after one or two
               attempts<!-- text diagonals down the page here for a couple letters. Mark?--><lb/> to
               conquer by crying the child would

            <p>I see it is exactly two months since I<lb/> last wrote in this book, and I hope<lb/> my little girl is improved both in<lb/> "body &amp; mind" since then. She suffers<lb/> a good deal from the changes of wea=<lb/><!--split word-->=ther we have had, and I have found<lb/> it nece&#383;sary to leave off milk as an<lb/> article of diet at present. She lives on<lb/> broth thickened with arrowroot, &amp;<lb/> I think this food strengthens her, but<lb/> she is still a delicate child, and back<lb/><!--split word-->ward in walking. I hope she will<lb/> not be hurried by any one in her<lb/> attempts at trotting about, for the more<lb/> I see and hear of children the more<lb/> I am convinced that when they<lb/> feel their limbs strong enough to<lb/> begin to walk they will constantly be trying their powers, &amp; that till<lb/><pb n="20"/> nature prompts this, it is worse than<lb/> usele&#383;s to force them to their feet.<lb/></p>
            <p>She is I believe a small child of her<lb/> age, though tall, and she has looked<lb/> (&amp; been too, alas!) very delicate since<lb/> that sad, sad illne&#383;s in the summer.<lb/> I am going to clothe her in flannel<lb/> waistcoats, and long sleeves to her frocks<lb/> this winter, and to keep her in <hi rend="underline">well-<!--word across line--><lb/> -aired</hi> rooms in preference to going<lb/> much out of doors unle&#383;s the weather<lb/> is very tempting. She has now had<lb/> eight teeth for some time, and is<lb/> about some more I fancy; perhaps<lb/> when her teeth are all through her<lb/> health may be stronger. Oh may I<lb/> try not to fasten &amp; <choice><sic>centre</sic><reg>center</reg></choice> my affections<lb/> too strongly on such a frail little<lb/> treasure, but all my anxiety though<lb/> it renders me so aware of her fragility<lb/> of life makes me cling daily more &amp;<lb/> more to her. </p><pb n="21"/><p>I think her disposition has im<lb/><!--word breaks over lines-->proved since I wrote last; she is<lb/> not so impatient (perhaps it was<lb/> the remains of her former illne&#383;s.)<lb/> she does not throw herself back in<lb/> the pa&#383;sionate way way she used to do<lb/> seven or eight weeks ago, and she<lb/> bears her little disappointments better.<lb/> The fewer she can have of these, &amp; the better<lb/> I think, and I try to avoid exci<!--word breaks across line--><lb/>ting her expectations, even when they<lb/> are pretty certain of being gratified,<lb/> for the excitement (which is always<lb/> so great in a child) is injurious, &amp;<lb/> produces a degree of impatience.<lb/> There are &amp; always will be <choice><sic>enow</sic><reg>enough</reg></choice> of disap<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>pointments to enure a child to bearng<lb/> them, and they will encrease with<lb/> years and with the power of enduring,<lb/> &amp; what I mean to say is that all that<lb/><pb n="22"/> can be averted by a little fore-thought<lb/> on the part of the parent or nurse, with<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>out interfering with the nece&#383;sary degree<lb/> of quiet but resolute discipline, should<lb/> be attended to and removed. I do not<lb/> like the plan in fashion formerly, of <hi rend="underline">ma<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>king</hi> trials for young children; there will<lb/> naturally be some which the child must<lb/> bear, and the parent calmly witne&#383;s, but<lb/> creating disappointments on purpose to<lb/> enure the poor little things to them in<lb/> after life seems like giving them rich<lb/> unsuitable food, which grown up people<lb/> may &amp; do eat, but which their delicate<lb/> stomachs cannot yet digest. When<lb/> young their feelings, especially those un<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>der the direct control of the senses are<lb/> so acute, which the powers which will<lb/> eventually it is to be hoped, control their<lb/> feelings are in a dormant state.<lb/> It is quite astonishing to see the diffe<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>rence bodily feelings make in Mari<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>anne's temper &amp; powers of enducance.<!-- manuscript check... punctuation missing here--><lb/><pb n="23"/> I was in a great measure prepared for this<lb/> by <persName>Combe</persName>'s <title>Physiology</title>, but I had no idea how<lb/> every change of tempre might be deduced<lb/> from some corresponding change in the body.<lb/> Mothers are sometimes laughed at for attri<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>buting little freaks of temper to teething &amp;c.<lb/> but I don't think those who laugh at them<lb/> (I used to be one) have had much to do<lb/> with children. I do not mean to say that<lb/> the habit of self control may not be given<lb/> and that at a very early age, but I think<lb/> that with ccertain states of the body, feelings<lb/> will exist which <hi rend="underline">ought</hi> to be controlled,<lb/> and that every thing physical tending<lb/> to produce those peculiar states of the body<lb/> shoudl be avoided, with as much care as<lb/> we would avoid anything moral tending<lb/> to produce moral will. I wish I could<lb/> act more upon this conviction myself;<lb/> want of sleep invariably brings on an irritable<lb/> state of excitement; and want of food,<lb/> though I may not have the sensation of<lb/> hunger, has in general the same effect.<lb/><pb n="24"/> I should describe <persName>Marianne</persName> as a child<lb/> with whom excitement should be particularly<lb/> avoided; and yet it is a very tempting<lb/> thing to see the little cheek flush, &amp; the eye<lb/> dilate, and the childish lip look so eloquent.<lb/></p><p>She is very much tired &amp; consequently more<lb/> irritable after a certain degree of play, &amp; <gap><!--unclear word--></gap><lb/> and besides her sensibilities seem to me very<lb/> acute.
