               is so hard a word to apply to one so<lb/> dear. But in general she is so good<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="#Marianne_Holland">Marianne</persName> is now becoming every day<lb/>
               more and more interesting. She looks at<lb/> and tries to take hold of every thing.
               She<lb/> has pretty good ideas of distance and does<lb/> not try to catch sunbeams
               now, as she<lb/><pb n="4"/> did two months ago. Her sense of sight<lb/> is much
               improved lately in seeing objects<lb/> at a distance, and distinguishing them.<lb/>
               For instance I had her in my arms
               today<!-- necessary to code the slight diagonal downward on the "day" here?--><lb/>
               in the drawing room, and her <persName ref="#William_Gaskell">Papa</persName><lb/>
               was going out of the gate; and she evi<!--split word--><lb/>=dently knows him; smiled
               and kicked.<lb/> She begins to show a decided preference<lb/> to those she likes; she
               puts out her little<lb/> arms to come to me, and would I<lb/> am sure, do so to her
                  <persName ref="#William_Gaskell">Papa</persName>. She catches<lb/> the expression
               of a countenance to which she is accustomed directly;<lb/> when we laugh, she laughs;
               and when<lb/> I look attentive to <persName ref="#William_Gaskell"
               >William</persName><!--Create xml:id for William Gaskell-->'s reading,<lb/> it is
               quite ridiculous to see her little face of gravity, and earnestness, as if<lb/> she
               understood every word. I try always<lb/> to let her look at any thing which
               at<!--split word--><lb/>tracts her notice as long as she
                  <unclear>will</unclear><lb/><pb n="5"/> and when I see her looking very
               intently<lb/> at <choice>
                  <sic>any thing</sic>
                  <reg>anything</reg>
               </choice>, I take her to it, and let<lb/> her exercise all her senses upon
               it-<!-- place spaces around dashes or leave words connected?-->even<lb/> to tasting,
               if I am sure it can do her<lb/> no harm. My object is to give her a<lb/> habit of
               fixing her attention.<lb/></p>
            <p>She takes great delight in motion just<lb/> at present; dancing, jumping,
               shutting<lb/> and opening the hand pleases her very
               much:<!-- long gap. Not sure whether to code this as a paragraph break or an empty space-->
               I had no idea children<lb/> at her age, made such continued<lb/> noises; she shouts,
               and murmurs, and<lb/> talks in her way, just like conversa=<lb/><!--split word-->
               tion, varying her tones &amp;c. I wish<lb/> we could know what is passing<lb/> in her
               little mind. She likes any<lb/><!--split word-->=thing like singing, but seems
               afraid<lb/> of the piano; today she even began<lb/> to cray, when I began to
                  play.<lb/><pb n="6"/></p>
            <p>In general, I think she is remarkably<lb/> free from fear or shyness of any
               sort.<lb/> She goes to <choice>
                  <sic>any one</sic>
                  <reg>anyone</reg>
               </choice> who will take her,<lb/> staring at strangers to be sure, and being<lb/>
               very grave while they are in the room,<lb/> but not crying, or clinging to me. I
               am<lb/> very glad of this, as though is is very<lb/> flttering and endearing to me,
               yet<lb/> I should be sorry if she were to get the<lb/> habit of refusing to go to
               others.<lb/></p>
            <p>Then as to her "bodily" qualifications.<lb/> She has had two teeth cut with very
               little<lb/> trouble; but I believe the worst are<lb/> to come. She is very strong in
               her<lb/> limbs, though because she is so fat, we<lb/> do not let her use her <choice>
                  <sic>ancles</sic>
                  <reg>ankles</reg>
               </choice> at all,<lb/> and I hope she will be rather late in<lb/> walking that her
               little legs may be<lb/> very firm. I shall find it difficult to<lb/> damp the
               energies of the servants in<lb/> this respect, but I intend that she shall<lb/> teach
               herself to walk, &amp; receive no assist<lb/><pb n="7"
               /><!--photo blocks the equal sign used to mark split word or there is none here-->ance
               from hands &amp;c. She lies down on the<lb/> floor a good deal, and kicks about;
               a<lb/> practice I began very early, and which<lb/> has done her a great deal of
               good.<lb/></p>
            <p>She goes to bed <hi rend="underline">awake</hi>; another practice<lb/> I began early,
               and which is so comfort<lb/><!--split word-->=able I wonder it is not more
               generally<lb/> adopted. Once or twice we have had<lb/> grand cryings, which have been
               very<lb/> very distressing to me; but when I<lb/> have convinced myself that she is
               not<lb/> in pain, is perfectly well, and that she<lb/> is only wanting to be taken
               up<!-- possibly a dash between: taken-up. Consult a better image--> I have<lb/> been
               quite firm, though I have some=<lb/>=times<!--split word--> cried almost as much as
               she<lb/> has. I never leave her <sic>till</sic> she is as=<lb/><!--split word-->=leep
               (except in extreme cases) and as<lb/> she is put to bed at a regular time<lb/> (6
               o'clock) she generally gets very sleepy<lb/><pb n="8"/> while being undressed. While
               the un=<lb/><!--split word-->=dre&#383;sing is going on, I never like
               her<lb/> to be talked to, played with, or excited<lb/> yet sometimes she is so very
               playful<lb/> when she ought to be put down, that<lb/> a turn or two up and down the
               room<lb/> is required to soothe her, still putting<lb/> her down awake. Sometimes she
               will<lb/> cry a little, and when I turn her over<lb/> in her cot she fancies she is
               going<lb/> to be taken up and is still in a moment<lb/> making the peculiar little
               triumphing<lb/> noise she always does when she is<lb/> pleased.<lb/></p>
            <p>Crying has been a great difficulty<lb/> with me. Books do so differ. One says<lb/>
               "Do not let them have <choice>
                  <sic>any thing</sic>
                  <reg>anything</reg>
               </choice> they<lb/> cry for", another (<persName ref="Madame_deSaussure">M<hi

               ought, I still think it a<lb/> good one. We must consider that a<lb/> cry is a
               child's only language for<lb/> expressing its wants. It is its little way<lb/> of
               saying, "I am hungry, I am very<lb/> cold," and <hi rend="underline">so</hi>, I don't
               think we should<lb/> carry out the maxim of never letting<lb/> a child have <choice>

                  <reg>anything</reg>

                  But<lb/><pb n="10"/> if it is improper for it to obtain the<lb/> object, I think
               it right to withhold it<lb/> steadily, however much the little creature<lb/> may cry.
               I think after one or two
               attempts<!-- text diagonals down the page here for a couple letters. Mark?--><lb/> to
               conquer by crying the child would

               aware that <hi rend="underline">one</hi> cry or indication<lb/> of a want was

            <p>I see it is exactly two months since I<lb/> last wrote in this book, and I hope<lb/> my little girl is improved both in<lb/> "body &amp; mind" since then. She suffers<lb/> a good deal from the changes of wea=<lb/><!--split word-->=ther we have had, and I have found<lb/> it nece&#383;sary to leave off milk as an<lb/> article of diet at present. She lives on<lb/> broth thickened with arrowroot, &amp;<lb/> I think this food strengthens her, but<lb/> she is still a delicate child, and back<lb/><!--split word-->ward in walking. I hope she will<lb/> not be hurried by any one in her<lb/> attempts at trotting about, for the more<lb/> I see and hear of children the more<lb/> I am convinced that when they<lb/> feel their limbs strong enough to<lb/> begin to walk they will constantly be trying their powers, &amp; that till<lb/><pb n="20"/> nature prompts this, it is worse than<lb/> usele&#383;s to force them to their feet.<lb/></p>
            <p>She is I believe a small child of her<lb/> age, though tall, and she has looked<lb/> (&amp; been too, alas!) very delicate since<lb/> that sad, sad illne&#383;s in the summer.<lb/> I am going to clothe her in flannel<lb/> waistcoats, and long sleeves to her frocks<lb/> this winter, and to keep her in <hi rend="underline">well-<!--word across line--><lb/> -aired</hi> rooms in preference to going<lb/> much out of doors unle&#383;s the weather<lb/> is very tempting. She has now had<lb/> eight teeth for some time, and is<lb/> about some more I fancy; perhaps<lb/> when her teeth are all through her<lb/> health may be stronger. Oh may I<lb/> try not to fasten &amp; <choice><sic>centre</sic><reg>center</reg></choice> my affections<lb/> too strongly on such a frail little<lb/> treasure, but all my anxiety though<lb/> it renders me so aware of her fragility<lb/> of life makes me cling daily more &amp;<lb/> more to her. </p><pb n="21"/><p>I think her disposition has im<lb/><!--word breaks over lines-->proved since I wrote last; she is<lb/> not so impatient (perhaps it was<lb/> the remains of her former illne&#383;s.)<lb/> she does not throw herself back in<lb/> the pa&#383;sionate way way she used to do<lb/> seven or eight weeks ago, and she<lb/> bears her little disappointments better.<lb/> The fewer she can have of these, &amp; the better<lb/> I think, and I try to avoid exci<!--word breaks across line--><lb/>ting her expectations, even when they<lb/> are pretty certain of being gratified,<lb/> for the excitement (which is always<lb/> so great in a child) is injurious, &amp;<lb/> produces a degree of impatience.<lb/> There are &amp; always will be <choice><sic>enow</sic><reg>enough</reg></choice> of disap<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>pointments to enure a child to bearng<lb/> them, and they will encrease with<lb/> years and with the power of enduring,<lb/> &amp; what I mean to say is that all that<lb/><pb n="22"/> can be averted by a little fore-thought<lb/> on the part of the parent or nurse, with<!--word breaks across the line--><lb/>out interfering with the nece&#383;sary degree<lb/> of quiet but resolute discipline, should<lb/> be attended to and removed.

            <p>This morning we heard a sermon from <lb/>the text "And his mother kept all these <lb/>sayings in her heart." Oh! how very, very <lb/>true it is - and I sometimes think I may <lb/>find this little <!--insert reference to journal itself, some sort of listbibl?-->journal a great help in <lb/>recalling the memory o f my darling child, <lb/>if we should lose her.</p><p><lb/>We have had much cause for thankfulne&#383;s <lb/>since I wrote last; she has daily improved <lb/>in health, and I think her character has <lb/>developed itself a good deal latterly, and <lb/>promises to be amiable &amp; affectionate.</p><p><lb/>I see I have generally begun my journal <lb/>with describing the bodily progress she <lb/>has made, and I will keep to the <lb/>proper order of things.</p><pb n="35"/><p><lb/>She can manage to walk by herself <lb/>with the a&#383;sistance of chairs, the sofa &amp;c <lb/>and the natural consequence of this <unclear><gap unit="word" quantity="1"></gap></unclear> <lb/>exercise of the muscles of her legs, is that <lb/>they have become more developed &amp; conse=<lb/>=quently stronger; indeed her whole body <lb/>bespeaks her a more healthy child. There <lb/>is that mottled look on the flesh, which <lb/>gives such joy to a <!--flag this-->Mother's eye. She has <lb/>eight single, and four double teeth, and <lb/>suffers <hi rend="underline">comparatively</hi> little when she cuts <lb/>them. There is lo&#383;s of spirits &amp; appetite, <lb/>but no fits, or even fever, and spirits &amp; <lb/>appetite come back, &amp; bring their atten=<lb/>=dant good-humour when the cause <lb/>is removed. She has a colour like a <lb/>cherry, instead of the shlushed wavering <lb/>red it used to be; and certainly with <lb/>health, beauty has come; and I confe&#383;s <lb/>I think beauty a desirable thing. True <pb n="36"/><lb/>like most other gifts, it has its tempta=<lb/>=tions, but still it is a high gift in the <lb/>influence it irresistably gives its po&#383;se&#383;sor <lb/>over others- an influence which may be <lb/>used for such noble purposes.</p><p><lb/>In general she is very sweet-tempered; <lb/>true there are little bursts of pa&#383;sion <lb/>which will require watchfulne&#383;s &amp; care, <lb/>but she soon <gap unit="character" quantity="1" reason="squiggles"></gap> puts up her finger, and <lb/>says "hush" &amp; offers to ki&#383;s the person she <lb/>has offended against. Another more <lb/>difficult <hi rend="underline">fault</hi>? is her disobedience- <lb/> She does not seem at present to have <lb/>an idea of obedience; she is very obliging <lb/>and will often do the thing we desire <lb/>her to do, but sometimes she resists very <lb/>merrily &amp; in good-temper - puzzling <lb/>me sadly as to the right course to take. <lb/>For instance when she comes near a great gap between two chairs, I call to <lb/>her to come back to <persName ref="#MrsGaskell">Mama</persName>; she laughs<pb n="37"/><lb/>and still goes on; in gerenal I get up <lb/>and take her up, &amp; let her down at her <lb/>starting point, where she begins again, quite <lb/>good-tempered. Once or twice I have let <lb/>her go on, &amp; she has had a slight tumble <lb/>which I have tried to tell her was in <lb/>consequence of disobeying Mama- <lb/>She is very affectionate; when I am poorly, or whenever she thinks <sic>any one</sic> <lb/>is hurt or sorry, she strokes their face, <lb/>saying "poor <persName ref="#MrsGaskell">Mama</persName>, poor <persName ref="#WmGaskell">Papa</persName> &amp;c"- <lb/>Her qreat delight just now is in make-<lb/>believe letters; reading her own from <lb/><persName ref="#Hannah-Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>, and introducing the names <lb/>of all the things she knows, such as<lb/>"flowers, geese &amp;c. <choice><supplied resp="#mjk">"</supplied></choice> This and pictures <lb/>delight her extremely, but certainly <lb/>she is not so independent as she should <lb/>be, and as I intended her to be. She <lb/>has not much idea of amusing herself<pb n="38"/><lb/>which has been a great error in her edu=<lb/>=cation hitherto, probably arising from her <lb/>delicacy in part.</p><!--unsure whether this is a true pragraph break - there is an unusual gap in the center of a line--><p><lb/>She is remar=<lb/>=kably fond of children, and I am glad <lb/>to give her an <choice><reg>oppy</reg><supplied>opportunity</supplied></choice> of gratifying this <lb/>fondne&#383;s by taking her this week to stay <lb/>a day or two at <persName ref="#Mrs.Collins">Mrs. Collins</persName>, who has a <lb/>little girl five or six months younger <lb/>than <persName ref="#MAGaskell">Marianne</persName>. She seems to have <lb/>a good memory, and good natural <lb/>talents; I hope they may never be neglected <lb/>through me.</p><p><lb/>Lord thou knowest that the "sin that doth <lb/>so easily beset me" hath overtaken me <lb/>once or twice even with this dear child- <lb/>but thou knowest too how bitterly I have <lb/>repented, and how earnestly I mean to <lb/>try for the future. Help thou my weak=<lb/>=ne&#383;s, oh Lord, and ble&#383;s my endeavours to <lb/>conquer myself, and oh above all things <lb/>may her presence be as holy to me, <lb/>checking each angry word that might <pb n="39"/><lb/> injure the precious soul which thou hast <lb/>given to this little child. Ble&#383;s her, and ble&#383;s <lb/>her mother, who in sorrow confe&#383;ses her fault <lb/>and prays for thy guidance in her future <lb/>conduct. Oh Lord God Almighty ble&#383;s my <lb/>child, as thou seest fit &amp; best for her, <lb/>but may she hear the glad words when <lb/>her mortal life is done, "Well come good <lb/>&amp; faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." </p>

            <p><lb/>The greater part of this summer has been <lb/>pa&#383;sed in rather an unsettled way, what <lb/>with the visit to <placeName ref="Knutsford">Knutsford</placeName>, <placeName ref="Warrington">Warrington</placeName>, and to <lb/>the sea-side, and I fear this is the only ex=<lb/>=cuse I have for so long neglecting to enter <lb/>any-thing in my journal. A great progre&#383;s <lb/>has naturally been made by the dear little <lb/>subject since writing last. I do not think <pb n="40"/><lb/>her health has had any material draw-back. <lb/>though for some time her languor in attempt=<lb/>=ing to walk caused me some uneasine&#383;s. <lb/>When we were at <placeName>Knutsford</placeName> (in <date>May</date>) <persName ref="W_Deane">W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. <lb/>Deane</persName> quite forbid her being put upon her <lb/>feet and the consequence of course was that <lb/>she lost the little idea of walking which she <lb/>had before. At <placeName ref="Prospect_Hill">Prospect Hill</placeName>she gained strength <lb/>though she had one violent attack, (beginning <lb/>with violent screaming as if in pain), but <lb/> we put her directly into warm water, &amp; <lb/>gave her castor oil, sending at the same <lb/>time for a medical man, who decided <lb/>that the inflammatory state of her body <lb/>was owing to being on the point of <lb/>cutting her eye-teeth. He said the course <lb/>I had pursued before he came was decided=<lb/>=ly the best and safest in all sudden attacks <lb/>with children. After these said eye-teeeth <lb/>came through, as to speak <hi rend="underline">very</hi> exactly <lb/>in the beginning of <date>July  1836</date>, when she was <pb n="41"/><lb/> two and twenty months old, she began <lb/>almost suddenly to walk by herself, and <lb/>since then her bodily strength has come on <lb/>very much indeed. For some time, indeed <lb/>even now we are very careful to comply with <lb/>her request to be taken "up, up", when she is <lb/>tired of walking, as I think the exercise <lb/>gives her such a pleasurable feeling, that it <lb/>must be fatigue and not caprice that lead <lb/>her to ask to be carried. She is very careful <lb/>and has a good idea of danger; not like <lb/>some children who have been forced rather <lb/>too early to their feet and seem not to be able <lb/>to measure distances. So much for her <lb/>feats in the walking line. She has now <lb/>16 teeth, and we thinkn she is cutting her <lb/>back double teeth, but as these give compa=<lb/>ratively little pain I do not feel anxious <lb/>about them. I have often intended to mea=<lb/>=sure her height, but somehow or other it has <pb n="42"/><lb/>hitherto slipped through; but from her frocks &amp; <lb/><!-- check this word-->que&#383;s she has grown a good deal these last <lb/>eight weeks, and good need she had of it, for <lb/>she was a little rolly-polly before.</p>
            <p>She is a famous chatter-box seldom letting <lb/>her little tongue rest either with sense <!--is this an f written over into an r?-->or non=<lb/>=sense, and it is amusing to hear her talk <lb/>in this latter fashion, inventing so many new <lb/>sounds in such varied tones. Her great de=<lb/>=light is in hearing "tories," and little scraps <lb/>of verse; and I think she shows a pretty <lb/>good memory in repeating them again. <lb/>We have not begun yet to teach her any thing <lb/>feeling in no hurry to urge her little capacity <lb/>forward, and in this we have been in many <lb/>ways confirmed. We heard the opinion of <lb/>a medical man lately, who said that till <lb/>the age of three years or there abouts, the brain <lb/>of an infant appeared constantly to be verging <lb/>on inflammation, which any <metamark rend="carat"/><add place="above"><hi rend="underline">little</hi></add> exce&#383;s of excite=<lb/>=ment might produce. If we give her habits <lb/>of observation, attention &amp; perseverance, in <pb n="43"/><lb/>whatever objects her little mind may be occu=<lb/>=pied with, I shall think we are laying a <lb/>good foundation, and four years old will be <lb/>time enough to begin with <hi rend="underline">le&#383;sons</hi> &amp;c, &amp; even <lb/>then it shall be in compliance with her new <lb/>wish to learn, which wish I must try to excite. <lb/>So much for <hi rend="underline">intellect</hi>. Now for morals.</p>
            <p><lb/>There have been times when I have felt, oh! <lb/>so cast down by her wrong-doing, and as I <lb/>think I am very easily impre&#383;sible, I have<lb/> fancied there must have been some great mismanagement to produce such little obsti=<lb/>nate fits, and whole hours of wilfulne&#383;s. </p><p><lb/>I do not however think that this has been <lb/>often the case, and when it has, my cooler <lb/>judgement has been aware of some little <lb/>circumstance connected with her physical <lb/>state that has in some measure accounted <lb/>for it. For instance, she, (like her mother) re=<lb/>=quires a great deal of sleep. She is <hi rend="underline">always</hi><pb n="44"/> <lb/>in bed, and asleep by seven, frequently earlier, <lb/>and seldom awakens before six at the earliest. <lb/>Then she requires from two to three hours sleep <lb/>in the middle of the day, and if by any chance <lb/>her time for sleep goes by she is weary, fretful <lb/>and as unlike the merry happy little creature <lb/>she is in general as po&#383;sible.<!--unsure if this is true paragraph break; long gap mid line--></p><p> We have <lb/>been puzzled for a punishment. The usual <lb/>one, putting the little offender into a corner <lb/>had no effect with her, as she made it into <lb/>a game to "<hi rend="underline">d</hi><add place="above">g</add>o into a corner and be naughty <lb/>little girl;" so the last we have tried is <lb/>putting her into a high chair, from which <lb/>she cannot get out, and leaving her there <lb/>(always in the same room with one of us) <lb/>till some little sign of sorrow is shown. <lb/>This with grave and sorrowful looks on our <lb/>part has generally had the desired effect <lb/>She often talks to herself about the consequences <lb/>of her conduct. "Baby <hi rend="underline">d</hi>ood <hi rend="underline">d</hi>irl, make <lb/><persName ref="Wm_Gaskell">Papa</persName> and <persName ref="Elizabeth_Gaskell">Mama</persName> happy." "Baby not dood<pb n="45"/> <lb/>dirl, Papa &amp; Mama so sorry." &amp;c I think for <lb/>so young a child she has a pretty correct idea <lb/>as to whether actions are right or wrong. I've <lb/>had an instance lately when <hi rend="underline">some</hi> <hi rend="underline">one</hi>, in <lb/>anger did what was decidedly wrong in her <lb/>presence, without considering how holy that <lb/>little creature made the place. She took no <lb/>notice, at the time but the next morning <lb/>told me of it, adding "that <hi rend="underline">was</hi> naughty." Though <lb/>much interested in preserving her love and re&#383;pect for the person to whom I allude, I <lb/>knew it was my duty not to weaken her <lb/>power of discriminating, &amp; said 'it was very <lb/>naughty, but she was very sorry now &amp;c." <lb/>A few weeks ago she got a habit of refusing <lb/>her food, saying "bye-bye" &amp;c when a spoon=<lb/>=ful was offered to her which she did not <lb/>quite approve. I found the best plan was <lb/>to take her at her word, and quietly sent <lb/>the plate away, which at first produed <pb n="46"/><lb/>sad fits of crying, and throwing herself back, but <lb/>after once or twice she became le&#383;s saucy, and <lb/>takes her food very pleasantly now. I think <lb/>she is not a greedy child, whatever her other <lb/>faults may be. She knows when she has had <lb/>enough. She gave me a very pretty little instance<lb/> of unselfishne&#383;s when we were last at <placeName>Knutsford</placeName> <lb/>which pleased me very much. We were calling <lb/>at <persName ref="Mrs_Deane">Mr<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. Deane</persName>s who has two children, one about <lb/>9 months older, the other about that much <lb/>younger than <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName>. A few comfits <lb/> were thrown on the carpet, which the youngest <lb/>child (little <persName ref="Emily_Deane">Emily</persName>) could hardly manage to <lb/>pick up. My own dear <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName> however <lb/>did not put one into her own mouth, though <lb/>as fond of them as could be, but crammed <lb/>them into little Emily. It made my heart <lb/> glad.</p><p><lb/>I am not aware that any promise <lb/>has been made to her that has not been <lb/>strictly fulfilled. And the consequence is <pb n="47"/><lb/>she has a firm reliance on our word, and a <lb/>pretty good idea of giving up a present <lb/>pleasure to secure a future one, feeling <lb/>sure that the promise will be performed. <lb/>While at <placeName>Grange</placeName> it was nece&#383;sary for her to <lb/>bathe, and I dreaded it for her. Luckily <lb/> her <persName>Aunt Ann</persName>, a capital bather was with <lb/>us, and undertook the charge of her, which <lb/>was so much better than being frightened <lb/>by being given over to a strange woman in <lb/>an uncouth dre&#383;s. We made the period of <lb/>suspense as short as po&#383;sible, undre&#383;sing her <lb/>directly, and giving her her plunges imme=<lb/>=diately. I stood on the rocks with a shawl <lb/>ready to receive her &amp; give her a biscuit, &amp; <lb/>though she often said while being undre&#383;sed <lb/>"Baby not bathe Mama," we never had any <lb/>crying or screaming. <!--long break within line again here.--> She has lately <lb/>had occasion to take one or two doses<!--smudge in this word, look more closely-->of Epsom <pb n="48"/><lb/>salts, and I have always told her before hand <lb/>they were bad bad, but were to do her good, &amp; <lb/>she has taken them directly, looking however <lb/>thoroughly<!--letters missing, or wrong word here?--> inclined to cry when the cup is taken <lb/>from her lips, but a biscuit as a reward <lb/>soon puts a stop to this. <!--long gap-->Sometimes as a <lb/>proof of our pleasure we have given  her <lb/>a spunge biscuit, 1/2 a doz comfits, or a bit of <lb/>pomfret cake, but we try not to make her ex=<lb/>-pect these things, which are only occasional <lb/>but to depend for her reward on our pleased <lb/>countenances and expre&#383;sions, and our <lb/>willingne&#383;s to play and romp with her. <lb/>This love of an earthly parent's approbation <lb/>we hope in time to lead into a higher feeling.</p><p><lb/>A few weeks since she saw the <lb/>funeral of a young girl in her walk with <lb/><persName ref="Betsey">Betsy</persName>, and showing in her way some <lb/>curiosity on the subject, <persName ref="Betsy">Betsy</persName> injudiciously <lb/>but very naturally told her it was a poor <lb/>girl that they were going to put into a hole <pb n="48"/><lb/>and cover her up with earth. This made a <lb/>great impre&#383;sion on her. Once or twice when <lb/>she has been awakened in the night, she <lb/>has so directly referred <!--word unclear!-->to it with signs of <lb/>affright, that we have concluded she has <lb/>been dreaming of it, and we have done our <lb/>best to counteract the feelings excited by <lb/>telling her the girl was very happy, and was <lb/>gone to <hi rend="underline">bo</hi>-<hi rend="underline">bo</hi> &amp;c.</p><p><lb/>She is very touching in her sweet little marks of affection. Once or twice when I <lb/>have seemed unhappy about little things <lb/> she has come and held up her sweet mouth <lb/>to be ki&#383;sed. Last night I was in pain, &amp; <lb/>made a sort of moan. She was lying by <lb/>me apparently asleep, but as if her gentle <lb/>instinct of love prompted her even then, <lb/>she peeped to me, saying "Ki&#383;s, Mama." <lb/>These are trifles but how very precious <lb/>may the remembrance of them become.</p> <pb n="49"/><p><lb/>We yesterday heard of a connection of <lb/><persName>William</persName>'s who had just lost his only child <lb/>a fine lad of nine or ten, by a sudden at=<lb/>=tack of croup. His father and mother were <lb/>wrapped in the boy, who had every promise of <lb/>excellence. Oh! how I trembled when I heard of <lb/>it, and felt how insecure these "treasures in <lb/>earthen ve&#383;sels" are.</p><p> <lb/>Oh God! give me that spirit which can feel <lb/>and say not my will but thine be done. <lb/>Teach me to love this darling chlld with perfect <lb/>submi&#383;sion to thy decrees. I dare hardly think <lb/>of the uncertain future, but thou wilt uphold <lb/>me in time of trial, and into thy hands <lb/>I commit my treasure. So with her Oh Lord <lb/>as seemeth best unto thee, for thou art a God <lb/>of Love &amp; will not causele&#383;sly afflict.

One day some one met <lb/>my <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt</persName> out of doors; she had been about an hour <lb/>out, and said she was hastening home, for she did <lb/>not think she had left <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">M.A.</persName> so long before; The little <lb/>girl slept in a cot by <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>'s bed; <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> <lb/>gave her, her breakfast, sitting on her knee, by a win=<lb/>=dow, with many loving little jokes between them. <lb/><persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> walked out with her, when the wea=<lb/>ther permitted.

But <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> <lb/>did not heed the little voice that kept petitioning <lb/>to be taken in, and when they told her "<persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> was poorly." she kept saying "<persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> <lb/>tell me if you are poorly." Of course she was <lb/>sent to a friend's till I came.</p><p><lb/>We were confined to two little bed-rooms in that <lb/>unhappy eight weeks, and the little girls could <lb/>hardly ever go out. But <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName> was a good <lb/>little comfort, though in such trying circumstances <lb/>to a child's temper. <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> asked to see her, about a week after her first seizure; and <lb/>I took her in. But the room was darkened <pb n="53"/><lb/>gloomy; <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> had had leeches to her head <lb/>and it was bound up, almost corpse-like, with <lb/>a handkerchief. <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName> was frightened I <lb/>think; and I was afraid <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>, though not <lb/>herself, and blind; (alas!) perceived it. The next time <lb/>she begged to have a night-cap put on, and had <lb/>a fig put behind her pillow, and <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">M.A.</persName> was recon=<lb/>ciled, and played about the room. She went in seve=<lb/>=ral times, and her coming always gave <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt <lb/>Lumb</persName> pleasure. It was such a beautiful spring <lb/>morning, that <date when="1837-05-01">1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of May</date>, when <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> died; <lb/> such a contrast to the dreary weather before.</p><p><lb/>On the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> we all came back to <placeName ref="Manchester">Manchester</placeName>; and <lb/>then I rather began to fear that the long confine=<lb/>ment in small rooms had <hi rend="underline">told</hi> upon <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName>'s <lb/>temper, poor darling! She was fretful, and rather <lb/>obstinate sometimes. But <persName ref="Betsy">Betsy</persName> was leaving us <pb n="54"/><lb/>and a new servant coming, which I do think is <lb/>a trial for a child. It soon wore off with patient; and <lb/>gentle treatment from her <persName ref="Elizabeth_G_Aunt">Aunt Eliza</persName>, who was <lb/>here at the time, comforting and being of use. <lb/>We have never told her that <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> was dead, <lb/>fearing that a child's material ideas, might connect <lb/>gloom with the idea of one so ble&#383;sed. "Gone to the <lb/>rest prepared for the People of God!" But I often talk <lb/>of her, and try to keep alive the reeducation<!--unsure of word--> of her <lb/>love and tenderne&#383;s, and show her <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>'s <lb/>picture, that even her bodily appearance (a fit shrine <lb/>for so chastened and pure a spirit) may stand <lb/>forth clear and distinct among her childish remem=<lb/>=brances. One day we were talking, and she said "<persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt <lb/>Lumb</persName> was poorly;" "No," I said, "she is well and happy <lb/>now." Is she, replied my dear little girl, "Oh then <lb/>I am so glad; let me go and coax her." And <lb/>since she has been at Knutsford (in September)<pb n="55"/><lb/>she has told me <persName ref="Aunt_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> did not live with <lb/><persName>Aunt A?</persName> now; she had left that house. I longed to <lb/>say she was "gone to a house not made with hands, <lb/>eternal, in the heavens." But I thought I had better <lb/>not, for to her it would have been unintelligible at <lb/>present. <!--pen shift-->Before she went to <placeName ref="Knutsford">Knutsford</placeName> in September, <lb/>she had again a few days of untractablene&#383;s, and obsti=<lb/>=nacy. But I think she was very judiciously managed <lb/>while there, for she came back a good little darling, so <lb/>gentle and loving. Indeed I should say that her <lb/>temper was very sweet, and her disposition very <lb/>affectionate. her little conscience too is becoming <lb/>very acute and well-judging. I think most of her <lb/>faults are of inadvertence (hardly <hi rend="underline">faults</hi>;) ex=<lb/>=cept now and then when she has a fit of obsti=<lb/>=nacy; but we are very steady in fulfilling our <hi rend="underline">threat</hi><pb n="56"/><lb/>of punishment, so these little obstinacies are gradually <lb/>disappearing. Our punishment for her is taking  her <lb/>and leaving her alone for five minutes or so, in a <lb/>light room. We tell her the length of time that she <lb/>may not think we are influenced by caprice, or <lb/>that she gains her point (of leaving the room) by <lb/>crying. Once and once only have we had recourse <lb/>to a severer punishment. It was one Sunday evening<!--check word for abbreviation--> <lb/>it may be about five weeks ago; we were trying to <lb/>teach her, her letters, more by way of occupation for <lb/>her these long winter evenings, than from any anxie=<lb/>=ty as to her progre&#383;s in learning. She knew all the <lb/>vowels but refused to say A. All the others she would <lb/>say, but would not even repeat A after us. We <lb/>got the slate, and drew it for her; but she persevered. <lb/><persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> was asleep so we were unwilling to provoke <lb/>the violent crying, which generally ensues when <lb/>she is taken upstairs; so <persName ref="WmGaskell">W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>.</persName> gave her a slap <pb n="57"/><lb/>on her hand every time she refused to say it, till <lb/>at last she said it quite pat. Still I am sure we <lb/>were so unhappy that we cried, when she was gone <lb/>to bed. And I don't know if it was right. If not <lb/>pray, dear <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName>, forgive us.</p><p><lb/>Since then we have not attempted any more le&#383;sons <lb/>till she shows some desire to resume them; and I <lb/>think she is coming round, for she delights in <lb/>getting a book, and saying to herslef, "This is A" <lb/>or O, as the case may be &amp;c.</p><p><lb/>She is not by any means forward for her age; <lb/>but not at all deficient in any thing. She has <lb/>never asked any question whatever that would <lb/>lead to any, even the most simple truths, of <lb/>religion. I am on the watch for any thing of <lb/>the sort.</p><p><lb/>She is getting both useful, and independent. She <pb n="58"/><lb/>does little things for herself and other people, and <lb/>thinks of things herself, such as fetching her <persName ref="Wm_Gaskell">Papa</persName>'s <lb/>slippers &amp;c. Today, he was going out; and she had <lb/>gone on a me&#383;sage into the kitchen, but when <lb/>she heard him trying to open the front door, she <lb/>ran, calling out Stop Papa Papa., you must <lb/>give me a ki&#383;s before you go.</p><p><lb/>And nowo for my little <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>; 10 months old <lb/>on the fifth of this month. she has a much <lb/>more pa&#383;sionate temper than <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName>; per=<lb/>=haps much livelier. But I sometimes fancy that <lb/>8 weeks spent day and night in one little <lb/>close room, may have had some influence on <lb/>her temper. she is very bright and sunny when <lb/>all goes right, and very affectionate; particu=<lb/>=larly to her <persName ref="Wm_Gaskell">Papa</persName> and <persName ref="Elizabeth-servant">Elizabeth</persName>, little, saucy <lb/>girl she prefers them both to her Mama. <lb/>I fancy she will be more clever than her <lb/>elder sister, if not so gentle. And there are <pb n="59"/><lb/>very fine materials to work upon I am con=<lb/>=vinced, if I but knew how. I am sometimes a=<lb/>fraid <persName>Elizabeth</persName> spoils her. She has had very good <lb/>health with the exception of one week, when she was about 9 months and a fortnight old; <lb/>the same age and cutting the same teeth as <lb/><persName ref="MA_Gaskell">MA</persName> was when she had her terrible illne&#383;s. <lb/>But if this was anything of the sort, it was not nearly so violent.</p><p><lb/>She has now had four teeth for 2 months or <lb/>more. She is taller and slighter than <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">M.A.</persName> <lb/>and stronger, as she can roll and crawl <lb/>away famously on the carpet. She is <lb/>like <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">M.A.</persName>; not quite such a pretty com=<lb/>=plexion, and no dimples, but longer eye=<lb/>=lashes. She can not quite stand by taking hold of <pb n="60"/><lb/>any thing, but very nearly. She has no little accom=<lb/>=plishments yet, but that is only for want of being <lb/>taught. She knows us all by name. Once or twice <lb/>I have heard <persName>Elizabeth</persName> distracting her attention <lb/>when in a little fit<!--check word--> by telling her to look for <persName ref="Wm_Gaskell">Papa</persName> <lb/>or Dicky (the bird) when they were not there. This <lb/>I am afraid I did not sufficiently check.</p> <p><lb/>The two dear little sisters are very fond of one <lb/>another. <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName> gives up any thing she has <lb/>if <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> wants it. Almost too much I fancy <lb/>sometimes. And <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> looks so relyingly for <lb/><persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName>'s help if she has lost any little play=<lb/>=thing or in any distre&#383;s. And she crows and dances <lb/>when she hears <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName>'s voice. Oh! how I <lb/>hope this love will last. I must do my best to <lb/>cherish it. Oh God help me in all my good <lb/>resolutions with regard to these two dear children <lb/>for without thee I have no strength. Amen.</p><pb n="61"/>

            <p><lb/>There is a new era in the little life of my dear <lb/>little girl. Tomorrow she goes to <placeName>Infant School</placeName>. <lb/>I think I am naturally undeccided, or rather <lb/>perhaps apt to repent my decision when it is <lb/>too late, but now I am beginning to wonder if <lb/>I have done right about this darling. There is <lb/>much to be said on each side. It <hi rend="underline">may</hi> weaken <lb/>her pleasure in home, her love for us all, her <lb/>confidence in me, at present such a ble&#383;sing <lb/>to me; she <hi rend="underline">may</hi> meet with children who may <lb/>teach her the menaing of things of which at <lb/>present we desire to keep her ignorant, that <lb/>we may give her correct ideas when her <unclear unit="word" quantity="1">mind</unclear> <lb/>is more advanced; such as Death, falsehood <lb/>&amp;c &amp;c. But our reasons for wishing her to go <lb/>to school, are also strong; not to advance her <pb n="62"/><lb/>rapidly in any branch of learning, for <persName ref="Wm_Gaskell">William</persName> <lb/>and I agree in not caring for this; but to per=<lb/>=fect her habits of obedience, to give her an idea <lb/>of conquering difficulties by perseverance; and <lb/>to make her apply steadily for a short time. <lb/>She is to go at half past nine, and come <lb/>home at 12; and certainly not in the after=<lb/>-noon at present, if ever. I think enough of <lb/>application may be got in the morning, and <lb/>I shall like her to be with me, with <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>, <lb/>out of doors &amp;c &amp;c, in the afternoon. I am <lb/>sometimes afraid of becoming a lazy <lb/>mother, willing to send my children <lb/>away from me, and forgetting that on <hi rend="underline">me</hi> <lb/>lies the heaviest responsibility. I will try and <lb/>be better in this respect. I intend as much <lb/>as I can, to fetch her from school myself; <lb/>I have several reasons for  wishing to do this <!-- check punctuation? --> <lb/>One is that she may not be much out of school <pb n="63"/><lb/>with the other children, though I have reason <lb/>to believe them to be all respectable, and well <lb/>brought up; but as she will be younger, she may <lb/>the more easily catch up any false ideas. <lb/>Then I mean to lead her to tell me in the <lb/>course of her walk home, all the little events <lb/>that have occurred in school. I can perhaps <lb/>set her right if her ideas get confused, and I <lb/>can sympathize with and advise her. <lb/>I have tried to decide in this matter for the <lb/>best, and now we must await the result; only <lb/>pray for God's ble&#383;sing upon her.</p><p>Since I last wrote, she and I have begun to <lb/>talk together about religion. I have told <lb/>her the simple truths I thought she could <lb/>understand, such as God's goodne&#383;s and love, <lb/>His watching over us in the silent hours of <lb/>the night &amp;c. I think she has now right ideas <pb n="64"/><lb/>as far as they go, about this important subject. <lb/>At first she perplexed me very much by her <lb/>very <hi rend="underline">material</hi> questions. "When does <!-- encode the emdash? --> go to <lb/>bed," &amp;c. But now we talk together in a low <lb/>tone, and she likes to hear about him, and refers <lb/>very properly to him as the "Giver of every good <lb/>thing." (Not her words, of course.) Her <persName ref="Aunt_Liz">Aunt Liz=<lb/>=zy</persName> is coming here soon, and tonight I told <lb/>her we should have <persName ref="Aunt_Liz">Aunt Lizzy</persName>here in three <lb/>weeks, if we were all well. "But whom must <lb/>we ask to keep us well." (M.A.)"God." After a <lb/>pause she added "I shall ask God to keep <lb/><persName ref="Aunt_Liz">Aunt Lizzy</persName> well too." She went to chapel for <lb/>the first and only time on <date>Christmas day</date>, &amp; <lb/>was I think a little tired, though she likes <lb/>much to talk about it.</p><p>She has picked up all her large letters, <lb/>and can arrange them so as to make Dog <lb/>Cow, Horse. She can say "The Little Busy Bee" <pb n="65"/><lb/>but I do not know if she attached much <lb/>meaning to the words.</p><p><lb/>Her temper continues liable to the same <lb/>fault obstinacy. In some moods if told to do a thing, she remains with her hand pat=<lb/>=ting her mouth, almost like one stupid; <lb/>it is then so difficult to move her, and it has <lb/>been <hi rend="underline">most</hi> difficult to find a judicious reme<!-- check punctuation --><lb/>dy. I am very sorry to say that after trying <lb/>several, we have been obliged occasionally to give <lb/>a slight whipping. It has been done sorrowfully <lb/>and gently, and has never failed in making <lb/>her more obedient, without producing the <hi rend="underline">least</hi> <lb/>resentful feeling. She is a sweet little creature <lb/>in general; full of good feeling. She would give <lb/>rather too freely to the poor. "I love you, and <lb/><persName ref="Wm_Gaskell">Papa</persName>, &amp; <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>, &amp; <persName ref="Elizabeth_servant">Elizabeth</persName>, &amp; <persName ref="Fanny">Fanny</persName>, and poor <pb n="66"/><lb/>people." <persName ref="Wm_Gaskell">William</persName> says he fears I excite her sensi=<lb/>=bilities too much; I hope not, for I should <lb/>dread it as much as he can do. I have no <lb/>time to write about our dear little <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> tonight <!-- unclear punctuation --><lb/>I must devote my next "<hi rend="underline">chapter</hi>" to her. In <lb/>the mean time I may just mention that <lb/>the two dear little sisters seem very fond <lb/>of each other. May God ble&#383;s them both, <lb/>and preserve them to us. "Neverthele&#383;s not <lb/>my will be done, <choice><reg>but</reg><sic>by</sic></choice> thine O Lord. Amen.</p>

            <p>Just a fortnight since I wrote last,<!--<pb/ n="unknown">--> and since that time I have had a<lb/> sad
               fright about <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName>, on last <lb/>Friday but one she had an attack of <lb/>croup about 8'o'clock in the evening. We <lb/>heard a cough like a dog's               bark,<!-- ended here at bottom of page; need previous entries coded to add correct pagination. Wanted to code this far to show evidence for dating this entry in 1838: Gaskell writes that the previous entry was a fortnight before, indicating that this entry is also from 1838. #mjk--> (she <pb n="67"/><lb/>had had a cold in her head, and had <lb/>seemed pale, and languid all day.) We <lb/>gave her <!--unclear-->21 drops of <unclear>Ipec: Wince</unclear>, and <persName>Sam</persName> <lb/>&amp; <persName>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Partington</persName> both came. They said <lb/>we had done quite rightly, and ordered <lb/>some calomel powders. Of course so much <lb/>medicine, and the nece&#383;sary confinement <lb/>in the house have made her not so strong, <lb/>and prevented her from going to school, but <lb/>we have reason to be most thankful that <lb/>she is spared to us, and I do earnestly <lb/>and humbly hope that I am truly thank<lb/>=ful. Poor little <persName ref="Eddy_Deane">Eddy Deane</persName> was taken ill of <lb/>croup on the same night; and died on <lb/>the following Monday. (Oh! may I bring <lb/>myself to a thorough resignation about <pb n="68"/><lb/>the afflictions which God may see fit <lb/>to send me; and Oh Lord, while I pray thee <lb/>to preserve my darling children, may I <lb/>not be too much wrapt up in them. Every <lb/>proof of <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName>'s delicacy seems to en=<lb/>=dear her more to me.</p><p><lb/>when I last wrote in my journal, I was <lb/>stopped by the latene&#383;s of the hour before <lb/>I had put down any particulars about <lb/><persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>. I have been amused on looking <lb/>at my former writing in this book to <lb/>perceive the difference between the two <lb/>little girls. <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> is far more independent <lb/>than <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName> was at her age, which <lb/>I suppose is owing to her having enjoyed <lb/>more uninterrupted good health. She can <lb/>crawl about any where as quickly as many <lb/>children walk, and if the door is open, <pb n="69"/><lb/>she is in the pa&#383;sage directly makinng to=<lb/>wards the kitchen. She can raise herself by <lb/>any thing on to her feet, but has no idea of <lb/>walking. She will play on the floor for an <lb/>hour at a time in preference to being <unclear unit="word" quantity="1"></unclear> <lb/>She has no idea of talking, though she is <lb/>constantly singing and making noises. She <lb/>is very affectionate, but not so sensitive as <lb/><persName ref="MA_Gaskell">M.A</persName> was, for instance she does not in the <lb/>least care for being laughed at, but rather <lb/>enjoys a joke. But I am afraid she <unclear unit="word" quantity="1"></unclear> <lb/>some little danger of being spoilt, for nearly <lb/>every one in the house pets her, and she <lb/>is very full of caprices, and sometimes <lb/> gives way to sad little fits of pa&#383;sion, if <lb/>she is a little bit affronted by the most <pb n="70"/><lb/>trifling thing. I am sometimes afraid she <lb/>is not checked enough; <persName ref="Elizabeth_Servant">Elizabeth</persName> (her nurse)<lb/>always says "poor thing, it is time enough to <lb/><unclear unit="word" quantity="1"></unclear>"- This I know is wrong, though I am <lb/>not sure if I act upon my knowledge. <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> <lb/>loves her <persName ref="Wm_Gaskell">Papa</persName> so warmly that I think his <lb/>influence may do much towards conquering <lb/>her little pa&#383;sions. If he says "Naughty little <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>" <lb/>she sobs as if her heart would break, so of <lb/>course we avoid such a working upon <lb/>her sensibility. She is generous in giving <lb/>a piece of anything she likes, but not <lb/>good in giving up a plaything, and when=<lb/>ever she sees <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName> occupied or a=<lb/>=mused by anything, that is the very thing <lb/>she wants to have. She wants every eatable <lb/>or drinkable she sees others having, and <lb/>what is more likes them all down to <lb/>rhubarb and magnolia. </p><pb n="71"/><p><lb/>In general the sisters are very kind to one <lb/>another, though sometimes I have been sorry to see <persName ref="MA_Gaskell">Marianne</persName>, without any anger, or any <lb/>apparent bad feeling, hurt little <persName ref="Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>, knowing <lb/>that she hurts her. I think it must be from <lb/>the love of power, but of course we try to check <lb/>it. May God ble&#383;s &amp; <hi rend="underline">preserve</hi> them both - </p>
