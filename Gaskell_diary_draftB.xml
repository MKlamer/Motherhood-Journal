               <p>In this first entry, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> devotes a lengthy portion of her narrative (3 full pages)
                  to writing about her own maternal choices - in this case, particularly her plans
                  for handling common parenting concerns, including bedtimes, how to respond to
                  cries and demands, and developmental milestones like learning to walk. This keen
                  awareness of motherhood is marked by self-doubt and an equally pronounced sense of
                  self-judgment stemming from Victorian assumptions about maternal duty. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> uses the diary as a means
                  to check her own maternal behaviors, writing: <quote>though I keep laying down
                     rules, I fear I have not sufficiently attended to them, though I hope I have
                     been conscientious hitherto in discharging my duty to her.</quote> These rules
                  draw in part on educational treatises of the day; in this entry she cites a text
                  by the French authoress <persName ref="#Mme_DeSaussure">Madame Necker
                     DeSaussure</persName>. <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>’s conclusions, however, are more rigid for herself than for
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>. While insisting that
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> not be pressured into
                  walking or learning anything before she is ready, <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> repeatedly reinforces her
                  commitment to her own duty to raise <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> according to strict principles, such as telling her
                  nothing but the absolute truth and selflessly placing her own needs after those of
                  her daughter.</p>
               <p>The dedication itself, where <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> hopes the diary <quote>will be reserved for [<persName
                        ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>] as a token of her mother’s
                     love and extreme anxiety in the formation of her little daughter’s
                     character,</quote> demonstrates even at the outset the depth of introspection
                  that <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> associates
                  with the diary form, and with this manuscript in particular. Although undertaken
                  to record <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                     <quote>character in it’s earliest form</quote>, the diary is ostensibly also a
                  record of Gaskell’s own maternal anxieties, and in being so, it is also suggests
                  her fears of maternal mortality, which echo as an underlying theme throughout the
                  diary, both in her repeated fears of loss and in her inclusion of prayers for her
                  daughters’ safety. The brief <quote>God bless her</quote> that closes this entry
                  marks a tendency to conclude her entries with prayers for her daughters’ health
                  and safety that continues throughout the diary. At all times, the relationship
                  between mother and daughters is colored by a pervasive fear of death. </p>
               <p><persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s first entry is
                  slightly over ten handwritten pages, and was likely written on the same date as
                  the dedication; the handwriting is similar in size, saturation and ink color.
                     <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> appears to have
                  often written in the evenings when her children were in bed; this and several
                  other entries indicate <quote>evening</quote> in the dateline. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> writes in this entry
                  about <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s bedtime routine;
                  she was laid down awake, at 6pm every evening, and since the entry concludes with
                  a comment about listening to <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s restful breathing during the time of writing, it seems
                  likely that this entry was written sometime after 6 pm.</p>

                  will be <lb/>six months old. I wish I had begun my <lb/>little journal sooner, for
                  (though I should <lb/>have laughed at the idea twelve months <lb/>ago) there have

                  good-tempered; though <lb/>at times she gives way to little bursts <lb/>of passion
                  or perhaps impatience would <lb/>be the right name. She is also very firm <lb/>in
                  her own little way occasionally; what <lb/>I suppose is obstinacy really, only
                  that <lb/> is so hard a word to apply to one so <lb/>dear. But in general she is
                  so good <lb/> that I feel as if I could hardly be <lb/>sufficiently thankful, that

                  <lb/>I pray thee to lead me right (if it be thy <lb/>will) and to preserve in me

               <p><lb/><persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> is now becoming every
                  day <lb/>more and more interesting. She looks at <lb/>and tries to take hold of
                  every thing. She <lb/>has pretty good ideas of distance and does <lb/>not try to
                  catch sunbeams now, as she <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>did two months ago. Her sense of sight <lb/>is much improved lately in seeing
                  objects <lb/>at a distance, and distinguishing them. <lb/>For instance I had her
                  in my arms today <lb/>in the drawing room, and her <persName ref="#Wm_Gaskell"
                     >Papa</persName>
                  <lb/>was going out of the gate; and she evi=<lb break="no"/>=dently knew him;
                  smiled and kicked. <lb/>She begins to show a decided preference <lb/>to those she
                  likes; she puts out her little <lb/>arms to come to me, and would I <lb/>am sure,
                  do so to her <persName ref="#Wm_Gaskell">Papa</persName>. She catches <lb/>the
                  expression of a countenance <lb/>to which she is accustomed directly; <lb/> when
                  we laugh, she laughs; and when <lb/>I look attentive to <persName
                     ref="#Wm_Gaskell">William</persName>'s reading, <lb/>it is quite ridiculous to
                  see her little <lb/>face of gravity, and earnestness, as if <lb/>she understood
                  every word. I try always <lb/>to let her look at any thing which at=<lb break="no"
                  />=tracts her notice as long as she <unclear>will</unclear><pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>and when I see her looking very intently <lb/>at <choice>

                     <reg>anything</reg>
                  </choice>, I take her to it, and let <lb/>her exercise all her senses upon
                  it-<!-- place spaces around dashes or leave words connected?-->even <lb/>to
                  tasting, if I am sure it can do her <lb/>no harm. My object is to give her a
                  <lb/>habit of fixing her attention. </p>
               <p><lb/>She takes great delight in motion just <lb/>at present; dancing, jumping,
                  shutting <lb/>and opening the hand pleases her very
                  much:<space/><!-- long gap. Not sure whether to code this as a paragraph break or an empty space-->
                  I had no idea children <lb/>at her age, made such continued <lb/>noises; she
                  shouts, and murmurs, and <lb/>talks in her way, just like conversa=<lb break="no"

                  <lb/>in her little mind. She likes any=<lb break="no"/>=thing like singing, but
                  seems afraid <lb/>of the piano; today she even began <lb/>to cry, when I began to
                  play. <pb n="6"/></p>
               <p><lb/>In general, I think she is remarkably <lb/>free from fear or shyness of any

                  endearing to me, yet <lb/>I should be sorry if she were to get the <lb/>habit of
                  refusing to go to others.</p>
               <p><lb/>Then as to her <q>bodily</q> qualifications. <lb/>She has had two teeth cut
                  with very little <lb/>trouble; but I believe the worst are <lb/>to come. She is
                  very strong in her <lb/>limbs, though because she is so fat, we <lb/>do not let

                  little legs may be <lb/>very firm. I shall find it difficult to <lb/>damp the
                  energies of the servants in <lb/>this respect, but I intend that she shall

                  it a <lb/>good one. We must consider that a <lb/>cry is a child's only language
                  for <lb/>expressing its wants. It is its little way <lb/>of saying, <q>I am

                  the <lb/>object, I think it right to withhold it <lb/>steadily, however much the
                  little creature <lb/>may cry. I think after one or two attempts <lb/>to conquer by
                  crying the child would

                  was sufficient, and I think<lb/> the habit of crying would be broken. <lb/>I am
                  almost sure even my partial <lb/>adherence to this plan has prevented <lb/>many

                  <lb/>and then by finding that crying causes <lb/>the irritation to cease. I think
                  this <lb/>is very true. I think it is the duty <lb/> of every mother to sacrifice

               <head>Children's Ages: <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, aged
                  11 months</head>
               <head>Elapsed Time: Six months since the previous entry</head>
               <head>Length of Entry: Seven handwritten pages</head>
               <p>The second entry follows the pattern <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> established at the outset of simultaneously celebrating
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s accomplishments and
                  fearing her loss. <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>
                  has carefully delineated her objectives for raising <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, many of which emphasize allowing
                  her to develop and learn at her own pace. To this end, <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> recounts that <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> recognizes many words and
                  individuals, but does not walk or talk. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> also continues with the
                  theme of maternal responsibility, her asserting rules that she <quote>tr[ies] to
                     attend to &amp; make the servants attend to</quote>. The cheerful mood that
                  begins the entry fades as <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> reflects on an attack of croup from which <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> has recently recovered. She
                  recounts her fear of losing her daughter, which was no doubt strengthened by the
                  memory of the stillbirth of her firstborn daughter fourteen months before
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s birth. <note
                     resp="#mjk">The stillbirth occurred in <date when="1833-07">July of
                     1833</date>; at the time of this entry it had been just over two years since
                     this loss.</note> The fear is quite poignant for <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>, and she copies a portion
                  of a poem by <persName ref="#Caroline_Bowles_Southey">Caroline Bowles</persName>,
                     <quote>To A Dying Infant</quote>, which was frequently used as a Victorian
                  epitaph. The entry includes a prayer of thankfulness that <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> was spared, which falls in this
                  case mid-entry. </p>
               <p>This is the only entry in the diary to have a significant portion of the text
                  missing. The top third of the second page has been removed, presumably cut because
                  the edge of the remaining page is smooth. The second page [recto] shows marks
                  where a small 2-3 fragment of the page is still attached to the binding of the
                  codex. Given the typical spacing of <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>’s handwritten lines, her habit of noting words broken
                  across the lines with equal signs, and the number and placement of the extant
                  marks on the fragment, we can assume that approximately six lines of text are
                  missing on the recto side of the page, and 5-6 lines on the verso. We can surmise
                  that the all of the text on the surrounding pages, together with the section that
                  remains from the lower section of the page, are all fragments of the second diary
                  entry, and that the lost sections did not include the start or endpoint of another
                  diary entry. This is clear because the following (third) entry, dated <date
                     when="1835-10-04">October fourth 1835</date>, begins, <quote>I see it is
                     exactly two months since I last wrote in this book,</quote> which indicates
                  that this second entry, dated <date when="1835-08-04">August 4th</date>, is the
                  one immediately preceding it.</p>

                     >Marianne</persName> was the same age that <persName

                  lost her own mother. The entry is preoccupied with <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s observations and
                  decisions related to <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                  physical health. She introduces her belief that in children, <quote>every change
                     of temper might be deduced from some corresponding change in the body.</quote>
                  She cites <persName ref="#Andrew_Combe">Combe</persName>’s
                     <title>Physiology</title> as one source of this conviction and describes in
                  detail <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s temperament. In
                  addition to offering examples of <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s <quote>self-government</quote> and her improvement in
                  patience, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> also
                  lays out again her mother-rules for raising <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>. Due to <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s fragility, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> plans to dress her warmly and keep her indoors during the
                  winter, and she has stopped feeding <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> milk, believing that thickened broth is a more
                     <quote>strengthening</quote> food. The entry concludes with a lengthy prayer
                  asking not only for <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                  health, but for <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s
                  own strength in the event that she should lose her only daughter.</p>

               <p><persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> continues
                  describing <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s development
                  and her own convictions about parenting in this entry. According to the
                  descriptions given here, the Gaskells were still calling <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>
                  <quote>baby</quote>. She would be an only child until 1837. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> both celebrates behaviors
                  that she interprets as the beginning of self-government, while also commenting at
                  length on <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s recovery from
                  an illness that is recounted in the previous entry. She mentions throughout
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s personality- that she
                  recognizes family, will share food, rarely cries, etc., and mentions her growing
                  vocabulary and general observation and attentiveness. Throughout the entry, in
                  addition to learning more about <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> - she still does not walk, and is still living on
                  thickened broth, which <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> believes has improved her health - we continue to learn
                  more about <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s
                  maternal instincts. She is deeply self-critical and sets high standards for
                  herself. In the opening of the entry, she criticizes herself for not having
                  written sooner, although it has been only two months since the previous entry. She
                  also claims that she <quote>ought not</quote> to be negligent in any regard toward
                  her daughter, including in this instance, in writing about her in the journal. Of
                  particular note in this entry is the penultimate sentence, in which <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> writes, <quote>I feel
                     weak &amp; exhausted with writing, or I had meant to write more.</quote> This
                  admission, in addition to underscoring the duty <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> feels to keep the diary,
                  foregrounds the weight which maternal writing held for <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>. This writing is not
                  merely record keeping or reflection; it is a deeply personal, emotionally invested
                  act which requires energy of the author. Even paper motherhood is taxing. The
                  entry, as many do, ends with a prayer, asking a blessing upon <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, and help for <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> as she fulfils her sense
                  of duty.</p>

               <head> Entry 5</head>
               <dateline>February 7, 1836</dateline>
               <head>Children's Ages: <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, aged
                  17 months</head>
               <head>Elapsed Time: Five weeks since the previous entry</head>
               <head>Length of Entry: Nearly six handwritten pages</head>
               <p>Although this is not the last entry in which <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> writes only about
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, it is the last one in
                  which she has only one child. By the date of the following entry, <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> was already expecting her
                  second daughter, <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Margaret Emily (called Meta)
                  </persName>. Six of the eleven journal entries, including this one, are written on
                  Sundays, usually in the evenings. <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> opens this entry with a recollection of the sermon text,
                  drawn from the Christmas narrative in <bibl>Luke</bibl>, which mentions a mother
                  treasuring memory of her son <note>See textual note regarding the placement of
                     this reading in February</note>. <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> connects the text with her own maternal practice of
                  actively seeking to remember her children, and specifically credits her
                  diary-keeping practice: <quote>I sometimes think I may find this little journal a
                     great help in recalling the memory of my darling child if we should lose
                     her.</quote></p>
               <p>After this rather melancholy opening, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> goes on to record <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s development according to her custom: first physical
                  development, and then social and emotional. Between the lines of the text,
                  however, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> has
                  inscribed another record, the record of her own re-reading of the journal. Beyond
                  merely suggesting that rereading the journal <quote>would</quote> be helpful in
                  the instance of <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s death,
                  Gaskell actually rereads her diary while she is living, as indicated by the
                  sentence, <quote>I see I have generally begun my journal with describing the
                     bodily progress she has made, and I will keep to the proper order of
                     things.</quote> Thus, even in writing the diary itself, <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> is prescribing and
                  following maternal rules. The diary too, must follow a carefully planned form in
                  order to be successful. It must be <quote>proper</quote>.</p>
               <p><persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> is on the whole
                  pleased with <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s development
                  here, claiming that her personality promises to be affectionate and pleasant,
                  although she bemoans her disobedience. The remaining diary entry emphasizes
                  obedience on two levels: <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                  disobedience in trying to traverse a gap between two chairs, resulting in a fall,
                  and <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s own
                  disobedience to her perceived higher calling as a mother. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> ends this entry with a
                  rather lengthy prayer element, in which she bemoans the <quote>sin that doth so
                     easily beset me,</quote> anger, as the rest of the entry would suggest, and
                  prays for help to control herself, particularly for her daughter. She “intends”
                  herself to be patient, just as she <quote>intends</quote>
                  <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> to be independent, and as
                  in much of the journal, she takes the responsibility herself, though calling on a
                  higher power to support her goals. </p>

                     >Marianne</persName>’s behavior is heavily dependent upon and affected by her
                  physiological status. She follows her established pattern, beginning with a
                  description of <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s physical
                  development, followed by her intellectual and moral development. The entry’s
                  physical description surrounds <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s learning to walk, which she did at the late age of 22
                  months old. According to <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>, upon the advice of <persName ref="#Richard_Deane">Dr.

                     >Marianne</persName> was kept from being put on her feet during a summer visit
                  in 1836, when she would have been nearly 21 months old. Following a “violent
                  attack” which the Gaskells treated with a warm bath and a dose of castor oil,
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> cut her eye teeth, and
                  subsequently <quote>began almost suddenly to walk.</quote> The narrative of this
                  milestone step exemplifies <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>’s attitudes toward development throughout the diary: while
                  eager to see <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                  achievements, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>
                  insists on letting her daughters develop at their own pace, and concerns herself
                  primarily with helping <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> to
                  develop habits of perseverance and patience, rather than insisting on her gaining
                  any particular knowledge or skills.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the diary entry emphasizes <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s intellectual and moral development; she enjoys stories
                  and chatters often, but <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>, as with walking, intends to wait on formal instruction
                  until <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> is over 3 years old.
                  She is pleased with her daughter’s awareness of right and wrong, commenting that
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> often talks to herself
                  about being a <quote>dood dirl</quote> [good girl], and even recording a situation
                  in which she observed an adult engaged in something wrong and told her mother
                  about it. Although she shows evident pleasure in <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s growth, <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> again closes the entry
                  with anxious maternal worries. Recalling the unexpected death of an acquaintance’s
                  only child, she concludes with the observation of <quote>how very precious may the
                     remembrance of [events recorded in the journal] become,</quote> and a prayer
                  for her strength and resignation in the face of possible loss. </p>

                  which she <lb/>had before. At <placeName ref="#Prospect Hill">Prospect
                     Hill</placeName>she gained strength <lb/>though she had one violent attack,
                  (beginning <lb/>with violent screaming as if in pain), but <lb/> we put her
                  directly into warm water, &amp; <lb/>gave her castor oil, sending at the same
                  <lb/>time for a medical man, who decided <lb/>that the inflammatory state of her
                  body <lb/>was owing to being on the point of <lb/>cutting her eye-teeth. He said
                  the course <lb/>I had pursued before he came was decided=<lb/>=ly the best and
                  safest in all sudden attacks <lb/>with children. After these said eye-teeeth
                  <lb/>came through, as to speak <hi rend="underline">very</hi> exactly <lb/>in the

                  months old, she began <lb/>almost suddenly to walk by herself, and <lb/>since then
                  her bodily strength has come on <lb/>very much indeed. For some time, indeed
                  <lb/>even now we are very careful to comply with <lb/>her request to be taken "up,
                  up", when she is <lb/>tired of walking, as I think the exercise <lb/>gives her
                  such a pleasurable feeling, that it <lb/>must be fatigue and not caprice that lead
                  <lb/>her to ask to be carried. She is very careful <lb/>and has a good idea of
                  danger; not like <lb/>some children who have been forced rather <lb/>too early to
                  their feet and seem not to be able <lb/>to measure distances. So much for her
                  <lb/>feats in the walking line. She has now <lb/>16 teeth, and we thinkn she is
                  cutting her <lb/>back double teeth, but as these give compa=<lb/>ratively little
                  pain I do not feel anxious <lb/>about them. I have often intended to

                  amusing to hear her talk <lb/>in this latter fashion, inventing so many new

                  connected with her physical <lb/>state that has in some measure accounted <lb/>for
                  it. For instance, she, (like her mother) re=<lb/>=quires a great deal of sleep.

                  <lb/>in bed, and asleep by seven, frequently earlier, <lb/>and seldom awakens

                  <lb/>in the middle of the day, and if by any chance <lb/>her time for sleep goes

               <p> We have <lb/>been puzzled for a punishment. The usual <lb/>one, putting the

                  <lb/>(always in the same room with one of us) <lb/>till some little sign of sorrow
                  is shown. <lb/>This with grave and sorrowful looks on our <lb/>part has generally

                  for <lb/>so young a child she has a pretty correct idea <lb/>as to whether actions

                  was only thirteen months old. Shortly following the birth of <persName

                  with her at the time, during her <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >mother</persName>’s confinement, and both <persName

                     ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> early in March until her death
                  in May. These events, <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>’s birth and
                     <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>’s death, are alluded
                  to by <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> early in the
                  entry, when she writes that “sad excuses” in some part account for the year-long
                  lapse between this diary entry and the one that preceded it. </p>
               <p>Much of the entry is told looking back on the months that have passed between the
                  entries, during which time <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> was born,
                  and <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> passed away. The
                  events were closely connected, in fact; <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> had gone to stay with <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb"
                     >Aunt Lumb</persName> had a paralytic stroke, and <persName

                     >Meta</persName> and a servant, Betsy, and remained there in rented rooms with
                  both girls for nearly two months until <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt
                     Lumb</persName>’s death on May 1st. A letter, dated <date when="1837-03-18">18
                     March 1837</date>, recounts <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>’s experience of <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt
                     Lumb</persName>’s illness. There is also a second letter, written to <persName
                     ref="#Holbrook_Gaskell">Holbrook Gaskell</persName>, tentatively dated in 1837
                  as <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> is the only child
                  mentioned; part of the letter is missing. The letter details plans for the
                  possibility of negotiating a new servant.</p>
               <p>The diary entry looks back on these events and comments tenderly on <persName
                     ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>’s care of both <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> and <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>, and recounts <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s careful management of
                  the situation with <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, who
                  was not told that <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> had
                  died. The later part of the entry discusses the differences between the two
                  sisters, commenting that <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>, already
                  ten months old, is livelier and physically developing earlier than <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, crawling “famously”. <persName

                  “acute” conscience, and is becoming “useful and independent,” often willing to
                  share with her sister and generally obedient and cheerful. <persName
                     ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>, however, is <quote>saucy</quote>,
                     <quote>clever</quote>, and <quote>not so gentle</quote> as her elder

               <p>In the dateline of this entry, the year is obscured, so that an 8 is superimposed
                  over the seven. As the entry follows an entry for <date when="1837-12">December
                     1837</date>, however, and the entirety of the diary continues in chronological
                  sequence, it is clear that this entry was written in <date when="1838-03-25"
                     >1838</date>. Although <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> is at this
                  time over a year old, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> appears rushed in this entry and writes only about
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, who is to begin
                  “Infant School.” <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s
                  maternal responsibility surrounding the education of her daughters is a fitting
                  topic in the wake of <persName ref="#Queen_Victoria">Queen Victoria</persName>’s
                  accession to the throne nine months earlier, in <date when="1837-06">June
                     1837</date>. The coronation had not yet taken place, but the country must have
                  been watching closely as they prepared for rule under a female monarch. The entry
                  foregrounds <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s
                  indecisiveness or doubt in maternal choices, and she uses the journal to weigh
                  both sides of the decision. On one hand, she worries, <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> may learn things at school from
                  the other children that she would not wish her to know, and may care less for her
                  home, but on the other hand, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> reasons, school will give her the opportunity to learn
                  obedience and perseverance, which are characteristics that <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> and her <persName
                     ref="#Wm_Gaskell">husband</persName> are firmly devoted to. They are not
                  concerned with <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s learning
                  much in the school, so much as her developing the necessary habits that will
                  underly her learning later. </p>
               <p>The entry builds upon <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>’s concerns with <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s education by discussing her initial mother-daughter
                  conversations regarding religious belief. <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> has attended her first Chapel service, on Christmas Day in
                     <date when="1837">1837</date>, at age 3, and <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> is pleased with her
                  understanding of the teachings so far. <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s language is developing; she knows her letters and can
                  spell a few words, and recite a poem. </p>
               <p>The entry’s closing allows an intriguing glimpse into the connections <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> makes between this early
                  diary and her later writing career. In the final paragraph, where she bemoans the
                  lack of time to write anything about <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell"
                  >Meta</persName>, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>

                  the first moment in the diary in which she likens her writing to its commercial
                  counterpart. This connection notably follows <persName

                  <lb/>and I agree in not caring for this; but to per=<lb break="no"/>=fect her
                  habits of obedience, to give her an idea <lb/>of conquering difficulties by
                  perseverance; and <lb/>to make her apply steadily for a short time. <lb/>She is to
                  go at half past nine, and come <lb/>home at 12; and certainly not in the after=<lb

                  be got in the morning, and <lb/>I shall like her to be with me, with <persName

                  <lb/>lies the heaviest responsibility. I will try and <lb/>be better in this
                  respect. I intend as much <lb/>as I can, to fetch her from school myself; <lb/>I
                  have several reasons for wishing to do this. <!-- check punctuation? Wilson and Shattock have period -->
                  <lb/>One is that she may not be much out of school <pb n="63"/><lb/>with the other
                  children, though I have reason <lb/>to believe them to be all respectable, and
                  well <lb/>brought up; but as she will be younger, she may <lb/>the more easily

                  sympathize with and advise her. <lb/>I have tried to decide in this matter for the
                  <lb/>best, and now we must await the result; only <lb/>pray for <persName

                  Meta’s case, she fears that the servants are spoiling her rather than attending to
                  them. <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> eagerly wants what her sister
                  has, and according to the entry, eats nearly everything she is given as well. The
                  entry ends with a brief comment on the sisters’ relationship, this time worrying
                  that although they get along well, <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> on occasion hurts <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell"
                     >Meta</persName> knowingly. The entry closes with another prayer for their
                  preservation, and a dash, perhaps indicating a hurried closing. </p>

               <p>This is the shortest entry in the diary, barely covering two handwritten pages. In

                     >Gaskell</persName> states that she had been interrupted when she last wrote,
                  which in part explains the brevity of this entry. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s focus here is on
                  comparing her daughters; <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> once again
                  is described as <quote>much the most energetic</quote> and constantly

                     >Gaskell</persName> worries that <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> is not <quote>industrious</quote> and requires guidance to
                  keep busy. <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> has improved
                  however, and <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> is
                  pleased to see that her former <quote>obstinacy</quote> is growing less frequent.
                  Even as she comments on her daughters’ achievements and cautiously observes their
                  faults, however, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>
                  takes on herself the responsibility: <quote>I am afraid I do not set her a good
                     example,</quote> she writes of <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s lack of initiative. In spite of this however, <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> has begun to read and sew, though
                  she is only four years old. The entry ends rather abruptly after <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> asserts that she still
                  ascribes much of <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                  behavior to physical complaints; she makes a consistent effort to keep her
                     <quote>quiet, as otherwise she suffers much from exhaustion which shows itself
                     in increased irritability.</quote> Here the entry ends.</p>

                     ref="#Queen_Victoria">Queen Victoria</persName>’s coronation took place,
                  although there is no indication that the Gaskells were at all involved in the
                  festivities. An event more likely to have affected them was the formation of the

                  things <lb/>in another person's house that one cannot regulate <lb/>(meals,
                  temperature &amp;c) that I feel a little anxious. <lb/>I think I did not mention
                  in my last account <lb/>that, since she was four years old (<date

                  that is spoken before her, and makes <lb/>herself understood too by signs and
                  noises. She <lb/>has walked this two months, being a very good <lb/>walker at 18
                  months. She has just cut her last <lb/>eye-tooth, and I am glad that trial is over
                  for <lb/>her, poor darling, though she has not suffered <lb/>much to what many
