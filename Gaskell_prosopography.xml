                     developed from a fishing village, was originally known as only Grange, until a
                     local vicar added the suffix in the late nineteenth or early 20th century.
                     Grange-over-Sands is located on the north shore of Morecambe Bay, in Cumbria.
                     The area was known for “clean sea air and local spring water” and became a site
                     for a sanitorium later in the century.</note>

                  <note resp="#mjk">After her marriage, Gaskell lived in Manchester with her husband
                     William, who was a Unitarian minister there. Although they moved three times,
                     their home remained in Manchester. Manchester was at the heart of the
                     Industrial Revolution, and many of Gaskell's novels feature factory workers or
                     the poor, drawing on her observations there. Daughters Meta and Julia, who
                     never married, continued to live at their last home, at Plymouth Grove, until
                     their deaths. The home has now been turned into the Gaskell Home Museum.

                     oldest daughter, and William, the baby, who was nine months old at the time.
                     Marianne caught scarlet fever and later recovered, but when Willie caught the
                     illness, he died at Porthmadog.</note>

                     paternal aunt, Anne Gaskell. At this point in 1836, both Holbrook and his wife
                     were still living. William Gaskell was left a legacy in their will in 1848/9,
                     and the property itself was inh“Aunt Anne” This is possibly Anne Holland,
                     Swinton Holland’s wife, but as that Anne would have been much older, it is most
                     likely Anne Gaskell, William’s younger sister, who lived at Warrington with her
