She offered a description of the Hall to William Howitt in a letter, having heard he was intending to publish a volume on "Remarkable Places". The letter was published almost verbatim in "Visits to Remarkable Places" in 1840. Apart from an earlier poem co-authored with her husband, this was the first time her work appeared in print. </p></note>

                     recommended for Marianne by her Uncle, Dr. Sam Gaskell. The town, which
                     developed from a fishing village, was originally known as only Grange, until a
                     local vicar added the suffix in the late nineteenth or early 20th century.
                     Grange-over-Sands is located on the north shore of Morecambe Bay, in Cumbria.
                     The area was known for “clean sea air and local spring water” and became a site
                     for a sanitorium later in the century.</p></note>

                     their home remained in Manchester. Manchester was at the heart of the
                     Industrial Revolution, and many of Gaskell's novels feature factory workers or
                     the poor, drawing on her observations there. Daughters Meta and Julia, who
                     never married, continued to live at their last home, at Plymouth Grove, until
                     their deaths. The home has now been turned into the Gaskell Home Museum.</p>
