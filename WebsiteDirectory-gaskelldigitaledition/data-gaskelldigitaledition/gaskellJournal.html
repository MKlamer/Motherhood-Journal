               <h2>Dedication</h2>
               <h3></h3>
               <p>Gaskell dedicates her
                  diary to her firstborn daughter, Marianne, who was born September 12,
                  1834. At the time of Gaskell’s death, Marianne was yet unmarried. She later married and had several
                  children; the diary has been handed down through Marianne’s descendants, and is currently
                  the property of Mrs. Sarah Prince, Marianne’s great-great granddaughter. </p>

               <h2>Entry 1</h2>
               <h3> March 10, 1835</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  6 months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Not applicable </h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: 10 handwritten pages</h4>
               <p>In this first entry, Gaskell devotes a lengthy portion of her narrative (3 full pages)
                  to writing about her own maternal choices - in this case, particularly her plans
                  for handling common parenting concerns, including bedtimes, how to respond to
                  cries and demands, and developmental milestones like learning to walk. This keen
                  awareness of motherhood is marked by self-doubt and an equally pronounced sense of
                  self-judgment stemming from Victorian assumptions about maternal duty. Gaskell uses the diary as a means
                  to check her own maternal behaviors, writing: <q>though I keep laying down
                     rules, I fear I have not sufficiently attended to them, though I hope I have
                     been conscientious hitherto in discharging my duty to her.</q> These rules
                  draw in part on educational treatises of the day; in this entry she cites a text
                  by the French authoress Madame Necker
                  DeSaussure. Gaskell’s conclusions, however, are more rigid for herself than for
                  Marianne. While insisting that
                  Marianne not be pressured into
                  walking or learning anything before she is ready, Gaskell repeatedly reinforces her
                  commitment to her own duty to raise Marianne according to strict principles, such as telling her
                  nothing but the absolute truth and selflessly placing her own needs after those of
                  her daughter.</p>
               <p>The dedication itself, where Gaskell hopes the diary <q>will be reserved for [Marianne] as a token of her mother’s
                     love and extreme anxiety in the formation of her little daughter’s
                     character,</q> demonstrates even at the outset the depth of introspection
                  that Gaskell associates
                  with the diary form, and with this manuscript in particular. Although undertaken
                  to record Marianne’s
                  <q>character in it’s earliest form</q>, the diary is ostensibly also a
                  record of Gaskell’s own maternal anxieties, and in being so, it is also suggests
                  her fears of maternal mortality, which echo as an underlying theme throughout the
                  diary, both in her repeated fears of loss and in her inclusion of prayers for her
                  daughters’ safety. The brief <q>God bless her</q> that closes this entry
                  marks a tendency to conclude her entries with prayers for her daughters’ health
                  and safety that continues throughout the diary. At all times, the relationship
                  between mother and daughters is colored by a pervasive fear of death. </p>
               <p>Gaskell’s first entry is
                  slightly over ten handwritten pages, and was likely written on the same date as
                  the dedication; the handwriting is similar in size, saturation and ink color.
                  Gaskell appears to have
                  often written in the evenings when her children were in bed; this and several
                  other entries indicate <q>evening</q> in the dateline. Gaskell writes in this entry
                  about Marianne’s bedtime routine;
                  she was laid down awake, at 6pm every evening, and since the entry concludes with
                  a comment about listening to Marianne’s restful breathing during the time of writing, it seems
                  likely that this entry was written sometime after 6 pm.</p>

                  good-tempered; though <br id="n31" /><span class="line-number">31. </span>at times she gives way to little bursts <br id="n32" /><span class="line-number">32. </span>of passion
                  or perhaps impatience would <br id="n33" /><span class="line-number">33. </span>be the right name. She is also very firm <br id="n34" /><span class="line-number">34. </span>in
                  her own little way occasionally; what <br id="n35" /><span class="line-number">35. </span>I suppose is obstinacy really, only
                  that <br id="n36" /><span class="line-number">36. </span> is so hard a word to apply to one so <br id="n37" /><span class="line-number">37. </span>dear. But in general she is
                  so good <br id="n38" /><span class="line-number">38. </span> that I feel as if I could hardly be <br id="n39" /><span class="line-number">39. </span>sufficiently thankful, that
                  the materials <br id="n40" /><span class="line-number">40. </span>put into my hands are so excellent, and
                  <br id="page 2"><br />Page 2</br><br id="n41" /><span class="line-number">41. </span>beautiful. And yet it seems to increase <br id="n42" /><span class="line-number">42. </span>the responsibility. If

                  I may, <br id="n46" /><span class="line-number">46. </span>and probably shall, very often. But oh Lord
                  <br id="n47" /><span class="line-number">47. </span>I pray thee to lead me right (if it be thy <br id="n48" /><span class="line-number">48. </span>will) and to preserve in me
                  the same <br id="n49" /><span class="line-number">49. </span>strong feeling of my responsibility which I <br id="n50" /><span class="line-number">50. </span>now feel. And you
                  too my dearest little <br id="n51" /><span class="line-number">51. </span>girl, if when you read this, you trace <br id="n52" /><span class="line-number">52. </span>back any
                  evil, or unhappy feeling to <br id="n53" /><span class="line-number">53. </span>my mismanagement in your childhood <br id="n54" /><span class="line-number">54. </span>forgive
                  me, love! </p>
               
               <p><br id="n55" /><span class="line-number">55. </span>Marianne is now becoming every
                  day <br id="n56" /><span class="line-number">56. </span>more and more interesting. She looks at <br id="n57" /><span class="line-number">57. </span>and tries to take hold of
                  every thing. She <br id="n58" /><span class="line-number">58. </span>has pretty good ideas of distance and does <br id="n59" /><span class="line-number">59. </span>not try to
                  catch sunbeams now, as she <br id="page 3"><br />Page 3</br>
                  <br id="n60" /><span class="line-number">60. </span>did two months ago. Her sense of sight <br id="n61" /><span class="line-number">61. </span>is much improved lately in seeing
                  objects <br id="n62" /><span class="line-number">62. </span>at a distance, and distinguishing them. <br id="n63" /><span class="line-number">63. </span>For instance I had her
                  in my arms today <br id="n64" /><span class="line-number">64. </span>in the drawing room, and her Papa
                  <br id="n65" /><span class="line-number">65. </span>was going out of the gate; and she evi=<br id="n66" /><span class="line-number">66. </span>=dently knew him;
                  smiled and kicked. <br id="n67" /><span class="line-number">67. </span>She begins to show a decided preference <br id="n68" /><span class="line-number">68. </span>to those she
                  likes; she puts out her little <br id="n69" /><span class="line-number">69. </span>arms to come to me, and would I <br id="n70" /><span class="line-number">70. </span>am sure,
                  do so to her Papa. She catches <br id="n71" /><span class="line-number">71. </span>the
                  expression of a countenance <br id="n72" /><span class="line-number">72. </span>to which she is accustomed directly; <br id="n73" /><span class="line-number">73. </span> when
                  we laugh, she laughs; and when <br id="n74" /><span class="line-number">74. </span>I look attentive to William's reading, <br id="n75" /><span class="line-number">75. </span>it is quite ridiculous to
                  see her little <br id="n76" /><span class="line-number">76. </span>face of gravity, and earnestness, as if <br id="n77" /><span class="line-number">77. </span>she understood
                  every word. I try always <br id="n78" /><span class="line-number">78. </span>to let her look at any thing which at=<br id="n79" /><span class="line-number">79. </span>=tracts her notice as long as she will<br id="page 4"><br />Page 4</br>
                  <br id="n80" /><span class="line-number">80. </span>and when I see her looking very intently <br id="n81" /><span class="line-number">81. </span>at <span class="choice"><span class="sic">any thing</span><span class="reg">anything</span></span>, I take her to it, and let <br id="n82" /><span class="line-number">82. </span>her exercise all her senses upon
                  it-even <br id="n83" /><span class="line-number">83. </span>to
                  tasting, if I am sure it can do her <br id="n84" /><span class="line-number">84. </span>no harm. My object is to give her a
                  <br id="n85" /><span class="line-number">85. </span>habit of fixing her attention. </p>
               
               <p><br id="n86" /><span class="line-number">86. </span>She takes great delight in motion just <br id="n87" /><span class="line-number">87. </span>at present; dancing, jumping,
                  shutting <br id="n88" /><span class="line-number">88. </span>and opening the hand pleases her very

                     </span>
                  I had no idea children <br id="n90" /><span class="line-number">90. </span>at her age, made such continued <br id="n91" /><span class="line-number">91. </span>noises; she

                     L’Education Progressive; ou, etude sur la cours de la vie was published in England in several volumes between 1829 and 1838. Gaskell must have been reading the original French; an English translation was not printed
                     in England until 1838. Mme Necker de Saussure was a Swiss woman of letters known primarily for this text. The quotation included
                     here (“les larmes des enfans sont si amère, la calme parfaite de l’âme leur est si
                     necessaire qu’il faut surtout aparquer des larmes”) is translated “The tears of infants
                     are so bitter, the perfect calm of the soul is so necessary to them, that it is necessary

               <h2>Entry 2</h2>
               <h3>August 4, 1835</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  11 months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Six months since the previous entry</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: Seven handwritten pages</h4>
               <p>The second entry follows the pattern Gaskell established at the outset of simultaneously celebrating
                  Marianne’s accomplishments and
                  fearing her loss. Gaskell
                  has carefully delineated her objectives for raising Marianne, many of which emphasize allowing
                  her to develop and learn at her own pace. To this end, Gaskell recounts that Marianne recognizes many words and
                  individuals, but does not walk or talk. Gaskell also continues with the
                  theme of maternal responsibility, her asserting rules that she <q>tr[ies] to
                     attend to &amp; make the servants attend to</q>. The cheerful mood that
                  begins the entry fades as Gaskell reflects on an attack of croup from which Marianne has recently recovered. She
                  recounts her fear of losing her daughter, which was no doubt strengthened by the
                  memory of the stillbirth of her firstborn daughter fourteen months before
                  Marianne’s birth. <br /><i>Note: (Resp:#mjk)
                     The stillbirth occurred in July of
                     1833; at the time of this entry it had been just over two years since
                     this loss.</i> The fear is quite poignant for Gaskell, and she copies a portion
                  of a poem by Caroline Bowles,
                  <q>To A Dying Infant</q>, which was frequently used as a Victorian
                  epitaph. The entry includes a prayer of thankfulness that Marianne was spared, which falls in this
                  case mid-entry. </p>
               <p>This is the only entry in the diary to have a significant portion of the text
                  missing. The top third of the second page has been removed, presumably cut because
                  the edge of the remaining page is smooth. The second page [recto] shows marks
                  where a small 2-3 fragment of the page is still attached to the binding of the
                  codex. Given the typical spacing of Gaskell’s handwritten lines, her habit of noting words broken
                  across the lines with equal signs, and the number and placement of the extant
                  marks on the fragment, we can assume that approximately six lines of text are
                  missing on the recto side of the page, and 5-6 lines on the verso. We can surmise
                  that the all of the text on the surrounding pages, together with the section that
                  remains from the lower section of the page, are all fragments of the second diary
                  entry, and that the lost sections did not include the start or endpoint of another
                  diary entry. This is clear because the following (third) entry, dated October fourth 1835, begins, <q>I see it is
                     exactly two months since I last wrote in this book,</q> which indicates
                  that this second entry, dated August 4th, is the
                  one immediately preceding it.</p>

               <h2>Entry 3</h2>
               <h3> October 4, 1835</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  13 months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Two months since previous entry</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: </h4>
               <p>At the time she wrote this entry, Marianne was the same age that Gaskell herself had been when she
                  lost her own mother. The entry is preoccupied with Gaskell’s observations and
                  decisions related to Marianne’s
                  physical health. She introduces her belief that in children, <q>every change
                     of temper might be deduced from some corresponding change in the body.</q>
                  She cites Combe’s
                  Physiology as one source of this conviction and describes in
                  detail Marianne’s temperament. In
                  addition to offering examples of Marianne’s <q>self-government</q> and her improvement in
                  patience, Gaskell also
                  lays out again her mother-rules for raising Marianne. Due to Marianne’s fragility, Gaskell plans to dress her warmly and keep her indoors during the
                  winter, and she has stopped feeding Marianne milk, believing that thickened broth is a more
                  <q>strengthening</q> food. The entry concludes with a lengthy prayer
                  asking not only for Marianne’s
                  health, but for Gaskell’s
                  own strength in the event that she should lose her only daughter.</p>

               <h2>Entry 4</h2>
               <h3>December 28, 1835</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  15 months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Two and a half months since the previous entry.</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: Six handwritten pages</h4>
               <p>Gaskell continues
                  describing Marianne’s development
                  and her own convictions about parenting in this entry. According to the
                  descriptions given here, the Gaskells were still calling Marianne
                  <q>baby</q>. She would be an only child until 1837. Gaskell both celebrates behaviors
                  that she interprets as the beginning of self-government, while also commenting at
                  length on Marianne’s recovery from
                  an illness that is recounted in the previous entry. She mentions throughout
                  Marianne’s personality- that she
                  recognizes family, will share food, rarely cries, etc., and mentions her growing
                  vocabulary and general observation and attentiveness. Throughout the entry, in
                  addition to learning more about Marianne - she still does not walk, and is still living on
                  thickened broth, which Gaskell believes has improved her health - we continue to learn
                  more about Gaskell’s
                  maternal instincts. She is deeply self-critical and sets high standards for
                  herself. In the opening of the entry, she criticizes herself for not having
                  written sooner, although it has been only two months since the previous entry. She
                  also claims that she <q>ought not</q> to be negligent in any regard toward
                  her daughter, including in this instance, in writing about her in the journal. Of
                  particular note in this entry is the penultimate sentence, in which Gaskell writes, <q>I feel
                     weak &amp; exhausted with writing, or I had meant to write more.</q> This
                  admission, in addition to underscoring the duty Gaskell feels to keep the diary,
                  foregrounds the weight which maternal writing held for Gaskell. This writing is not
                  merely record keeping or reflection; it is a deeply personal, emotionally invested
                  act which requires energy of the author. Even paper motherhood is taxing. The
                  entry, as many do, ends with a prayer, asking a blessing upon Marianne, and help for Gaskell as she fulfils her sense
                  of duty.</p>

                  she <br id="n555" /><span class="line-number">555. </span> is easily calmed, and we have begun to try <br id="n556" /><span class="line-number">556. </span> and make her show

               <p><br id="n580" /><span class="line-number">580. </span>She is not greedy though often very <br id="n581" /><span class="line-number">581. </span>hungry; but I think at any time she

                  will come naturally <br id="n588" /><span class="line-number">588. </span>when she sees that we are scrupulous <br id="n589" /><span class="line-number">589. </span>in respecting

               <br id="page 30"><br />Page 30</br>
               
               <p>A few weeks ago her grandmama
                  sent <br id="n590" /><span class="line-number">590. </span>her some sweet biscuits, and at first <br id="n591" /><span class="line-number">591. </span>I feared she was inclined to
                  be selfish <br id="n592" /><span class="line-number">592. </span>with these luxuries, for she had never tasted <br id="n593" /><span class="line-number">593. </span>anything sweet
                  before. She refused occasion=<br id="n594" /><span class="line-number">594. </span>=ally when we asked for a bit, instead of
                  <br id="n595" /><span class="line-number">595. </span>offering with her own accord, but it wore off <br id="n596" /><span class="line-number">596. </span>and now she gives as
                  freely as ever.</p>
               
               <p><br id="n597" /><span class="line-number">597. </span>She is remarkably good in being content <br id="n598" /><span class="line-number">598. </span>with a refusal, if we do not
                  think any <br id="n599" /><span class="line-number">599. </span>Eatable proper for her. She ki<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>ses, &amp; points &amp; <br id="n600" /><span class="line-number">600. </span>tries to speak, but does not cry when we
                  <br id="n601" /><span class="line-number">601. </span>say no. I speak in general for of course there are times when she is not so
                  good. <br id="n602" /><span class="line-number">602. </span>Her greatest naughtine<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s is in being washed <br id="n603" /><span class="line-number">603. </span>&amp; dre<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sed. She cries sadly over the washing <br id="n604" /><span class="line-number">604. </span>which I think must be owing to
                  her <br id="n605" /><span class="line-number">605. </span>having been put in <sup>it</sup> too cold sometimes. <br id="n606" /><span class="line-number">606. </span>She
                  dislikes <u>finishing</u> her food, and by <br id="n607" /><span class="line-number">607. </span>a

                  dependent on <br id="n612" /><span class="line-number">612. </span>others, for instance if when sitting on <br id="n613" /><span class="line-number">613. </span>the floor a
                  plaything rolls away, she has <br id="n614" /><span class="line-number">614. </span>no idea of scrabling after it, but looks
                  <br id="n615" /><span class="line-number">615. </span>up beseechingly for some one to help her. <br id="n616" /><span class="line-number">616. </span>To be sure she is very weak in

               <p><br id="n619" /><span class="line-number">619. </span>She is extremely fond of her Papa,
                  shouting <br id="n620" /><span class="line-number">620. </span>out his name whenever she hears his <br id="n621" /><span class="line-number">621. </span>footsteps, never mistaking
                  it, and dancing <br id="n622" /><span class="line-number">622. </span>with delight when she hears the bell which <br id="n623" /><span class="line-number">623. </span>is a signal
                  for her to come in after din=<br id="n624" /><span class="line-number">624. </span>=ner.</p>
               
               <p><br id="n625" /><span class="line-number">625. </span>She will talk before she walks I think- <br id="n626" /><span class="line-number">626. </span>She can say pretty plainly

               <h2> Entry 5</h2>
               <h3>February 7, 1836</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  17 months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Five weeks since the previous entry</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: Nearly six handwritten pages</h4>
               <p>Although this is not the last entry in which Gaskell writes only about
                  Marianne, it is the last one in
                  which she has only one child. By the date of the following entry, Gaskell was already expecting her
                  second daughter, Margaret Emily (called Meta)
                  . Six of the eleven journal entries, including this one, are written on
                  Sundays, usually in the evenings. Gaskell opens this entry with a recollection of the sermon text,
                  drawn from the Christmas narrative in Luke, which mentions a mother
                  treasuring memory of her son <br /><i>Note: (Resp:)
                     See textual note regarding the placement of
                     this reading in February</i>. Gaskell connects the text with her own maternal practice of
                  actively seeking to remember her children, and specifically credits her
                  diary-keeping practice: <q>I sometimes think I may find this little journal a
                     great help in recalling the memory of my darling child if we should lose
                     her.</q></p>
               <p>After this rather melancholy opening, Gaskell goes on to record Marianne’s development according to her custom: first physical
                  development, and then social and emotional. Between the lines of the text,
                  however, Gaskell has
                  inscribed another record, the record of her own re-reading of the journal. Beyond
                  merely suggesting that rereading the journal <q>would</q> be helpful in
                  the instance of Marianne’s death,
                  Gaskell actually rereads her diary while she is living, as indicated by the
                  sentence, <q>I see I have generally begun my journal with describing the
                     bodily progress she has made, and I will keep to the proper order of
                     things.</q> Thus, even in writing the diary itself, Gaskell is prescribing and
                  following maternal rules. The diary too, must follow a carefully planned form in
                  order to be successful. It must be <q>proper</q>.</p>
               <p>Gaskell is on the whole
                  pleased with Marianne’s development
                  here, claiming that her personality promises to be affectionate and pleasant,
                  although she bemoans her disobedience. The remaining diary entry emphasizes
                  obedience on two levels: Marianne’s
                  disobedience in trying to traverse a gap between two chairs, resulting in a fall,
                  and Gaskell’s own
                  disobedience to her perceived higher calling as a mother. Gaskell ends this entry with a
                  rather lengthy prayer element, in which she bemoans the <q>sin that doth so
                     easily beset me,</q> anger, as the rest of the entry would suggest, and
                  prays for help to control herself, particularly for her daughter. She “intends”
                  herself to be patient, just as she <q>intends</q>
                  Marianne to be independent, and as
                  in much of the journal, she takes the responsibility herself, though calling on a
                  higher power to support her goals. </p>

               <h2>Entry 6</h2>
               <h3>November 5, 1836</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  26 months old; Gaskell was
                  expecting Meta at the time.</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Nine months have passed since the last entry.</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: Eleven and a half handwritten pages.</h4>
               <p>The sixth entry foregrounds Gaskell’s belief that Marianne’s behavior is heavily dependent upon and affected by her
                  physiological status. She follows her established pattern, beginning with a
                  description of Marianne’s physical
                  development, followed by her intellectual and moral development. The entry’s
                  physical description surrounds Marianne’s learning to walk, which she did at the late age of 22
                  months old. According to Gaskell, upon the advice of Dr.
                  Richard Deane, a partner in her Uncle Peter Holland’s medical practice in
                  Knutsford, Marianne was kept from being put on her feet during a summer visit
                  in 1836, when she would have been nearly 21 months old. Following a “violent
                  attack” which the Gaskells treated with a warm bath and a dose of castor oil,
                  Marianne cut her eye teeth, and
                  subsequently <q>began almost suddenly to walk.</q> The narrative of this
                  milestone step exemplifies Gaskell’s attitudes toward development throughout the diary: while
                  eager to see Marianne’s
                  achievements, Gaskell
                  insists on letting her daughters develop at their own pace, and concerns herself
                  primarily with helping Marianne to
                  develop habits of perseverance and patience, rather than insisting on her gaining
                  any particular knowledge or skills.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the diary entry emphasizes Marianne’s intellectual and moral development; she enjoys stories
                  and chatters often, but Gaskell, as with walking, intends to wait on formal instruction
                  until Marianne is over 3 years old.
                  She is pleased with her daughter’s awareness of right and wrong, commenting that
                  Marianne often talks to herself
                  about being a <q>dood dirl</q> [good girl], and even recording a situation
                  in which she observed an adult engaged in something wrong and told her mother
                  about it. Although she shows evident pleasure in Marianne’s growth, Gaskell again closes the entry
                  with anxious maternal worries. Recalling the unexpected death of an acquaintance’s
                  only child, she concludes with the observation of <q>how very precious may the
                     remembrance of [events recorded in the journal] become,</q> and a prayer
                  for her strength and resignation in the face of possible loss. </p>

                  and the consequence of course was that <br id="n773" /><span class="line-number">773. </span>she lost the little idea of walking
                  which she <br id="n774" /><span class="line-number">774. </span>had before. At Prospect

                  body <br id="n781" /><span class="line-number">781. </span>was owing to being on the point of <br id="n782" /><span class="line-number">782. </span>cutting her eye-teeth. He said

                  beginning of July 1836, when she was <br id="page 40"><br />Page 40</br><br id="n788" /><span class="line-number">788. </span> two and twenty
                  months old, she began <br id="n789" /><span class="line-number">789. </span>almost suddenly to walk by herself, and <br id="n790" /><span class="line-number">790. </span>since then
                  her bodily strength has come on <br id="n791" /><span class="line-number">791. </span>very much indeed. For some time, indeed
                  <br id="n792" /><span class="line-number">792. </span>even now we are very careful to comply with <br id="n793" /><span class="line-number">793. </span>her request to be taken "up,

                  such a pleasurable feeling, that it <br id="n796" /><span class="line-number">796. </span>must be fatigue and not caprice that lead
                  <br id="n797" /><span class="line-number">797. </span>her to ask to be carried. She is very careful <br id="n798" /><span class="line-number">798. </span>and has a good idea of
                  danger; not like <br id="n799" /><span class="line-number">799. </span>some children who have been forced rather <br id="n800" /><span class="line-number">800. </span>too early to

               <p>She is a famous chatter-box seldom letting <br id="n812" /><span class="line-number">812. </span>her little tongue rest either with

                  amusing to hear her talk <br id="n814" /><span class="line-number">814. </span>in this latter fashion, inventing so many new
                  <br id="n815" /><span class="line-number">815. </span>sounds in such varied tones. Her great de=<br id="n816" /><span class="line-number">816. </span>=light is in hearing "tories,"
                  and little scraps <br id="n817" /><span class="line-number">817. </span>of verse; and I think she shows a pretty <br id="n818" /><span class="line-number">818. </span>good memory
                  in repeating them again. <br id="n819" /><span class="line-number">819. </span>We have not begun yet to teach her any thing
                  <br id="n820" /><span class="line-number">820. </span>feeling in no hurry to urge her little capacity <br id="n821" /><span class="line-number">821. </span>forward, and in this we
                  have been in many <br id="n822" /><span class="line-number">822. </span>ways confirmed. We heard the opinion of <br id="n823" /><span class="line-number">823. </span>a medical man
                  lately, who said that till <br id="n824" /><span class="line-number">824. </span>the age of three years or there abouts, the brain
                  <br id="n825" /><span class="line-number">825. </span>of an infant appeared constantly to be verging <br id="n826" /><span class="line-number">826. </span>on inflammation, which

                  <br id="n831" /><span class="line-number">831. </span>good foundation, and four years old will be <br id="n832" /><span class="line-number">832. </span>time enough to begin with

               <p><br id="n836" /><span class="line-number">836. </span>There have been times when I have felt, oh! <br id="n837" /><span class="line-number">837. </span>so cast down by her
                  wrong-doing, and as I <br id="n838" /><span class="line-number">838. </span>think I am very easily impre<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sible, I have<br id="n839" /><span class="line-number">839. </span> fancied there must have been some great mismanagement
                  to produce such little obsti=<br id="n840" /><span class="line-number">840. </span>nate fits, and whole hours of wilfulne<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s. </p>
               
               <p><br id="n841" /><span class="line-number">841. </span>I do not however think that this has been <br id="n842" /><span class="line-number">842. </span>often the case, and when it
                  has, my cooler <br id="n843" /><span class="line-number">843. </span>judgement has been aware of some little <br id="n844" /><span class="line-number">844. </span>circumstance
                  connected with her physical <br id="n845" /><span class="line-number">845. </span>state that has in some measure accounted <br id="n846" /><span class="line-number">846. </span>for
                  it. For instance, she, (like her mother) re=<br id="n847" /><span class="line-number">847. </span>=quires a great deal of sleep.
                  She is <u>always</u><br id="page 43"><br />Page 43</br>
                  <br id="n848" /><span class="line-number">848. </span>in bed, and asleep by seven, frequently earlier, <br id="n849" /><span class="line-number">849. </span>and seldom awakens
                  before six at the earliest. <br id="n850" /><span class="line-number">850. </span>Then she requires from two to three hours sleep
                  <br id="n851" /><span class="line-number">851. </span>in the middle of the day, and if by any chance <br id="n852" /><span class="line-number">852. </span>her time for sleep goes
                  by she is weary, fretful <br id="n853" /><span class="line-number">853. </span>and as unlike the merry happy little creature
                  <br id="n854" /><span class="line-number">854. </span>she is in general as po<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sible.</p>
               
               <p> We have <br id="n855" /><span class="line-number">855. </span>been puzzled for a punishment. The usual <br id="n856" /><span class="line-number">856. </span>one, putting the
                  little offender into a corner <br id="n857" /><span class="line-number">857. </span>had no effect with her, as she made it into
                  <br id="n858" /><span class="line-number">858. </span>a game to "<u>d</u><sup>g</sup>o into a
                  corner and be naughty <br id="n859" /><span class="line-number">859. </span>little girl;" so the last we have tried is <br id="n860" /><span class="line-number">860. </span>putting
                  her into a high chair, from which <br id="n861" /><span class="line-number">861. </span>she cannot get out, and leaving her there
                  <br id="n862" /><span class="line-number">862. </span>(always in the same room with one of us) <br id="n863" /><span class="line-number">863. </span>till some little sign of sorrow
                  is shown. <br id="n864" /><span class="line-number">864. </span>This with grave and sorrowful looks on our <br id="n865" /><span class="line-number">865. </span>part has generally
                  had the desired effect <br id="n866" /><span class="line-number">866. </span>She often talks to herself about the consequences
                  <br id="n867" /><span class="line-number">867. </span>of her conduct. "Baby <u>d</u>ood <u>d</u>irl, make <br id="n868" /><span class="line-number">868. </span>Papa and Mama happy." "Baby not dood<br id="page 44"><br />Page 44</br>
                  <br id="n869" /><span class="line-number">869. </span>dirl, Papa &amp; Mama so sorry." &amp;c I think
                  for <br id="n870" /><span class="line-number">870. </span>so young a child she has a pretty correct idea <br id="n871" /><span class="line-number">871. </span>as to whether actions
                  are right or wrong. I've <br id="n872" /><span class="line-number">872. </span>had an instance lately when <u>some</u>
                  <u>one</u>, in <br id="n873" /><span class="line-number">873. </span>anger did what was decidedly wrong in her
                  <br id="n874" /><span class="line-number">874. </span>presence, without considering how holy that <br id="n875" /><span class="line-number">875. </span>little creature made the
                  place. She took no <br id="n876" /><span class="line-number">876. </span>notice, at the time but the next morning <br id="n877" /><span class="line-number">877. </span>told me of
                  it, adding <q>that <u>was</u> naughty.</q> Though <br id="n878" /><span class="line-number">878. </span>much
                  interested in preserving her love and <br id="n879" /><span class="line-number">879. </span>re<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>pect for the person to whom I allude, I <br id="n880" /><span class="line-number">880. </span>knew it was my duty not to
                  weaken her <br id="n881" /><span class="line-number">881. </span>power of discriminating, &amp; said <q>it was very <br id="n882" /><span class="line-number">882. </span>naughty, but
                     she was very sorry now &amp;c.</q> <br id="n883" /><span class="line-number">883. </span>A few weeks ago she got a habit of refusing
                  <br id="n884" /><span class="line-number">884. </span>her food, saying <q>bye-bye</q> &amp;c when a spoon=<br id="n885" /><span class="line-number">885. </span>=ful was offered to her
                  which she did not <br id="n886" /><span class="line-number">886. </span>quite approve. I found the best plan was <br id="n887" /><span class="line-number">887. </span>to take her
                  at her word, and quietly sent <br id="n888" /><span class="line-number">888. </span>the plate away, which at first produed <br id="page 45"><br />Page 45</br><br id="n889" /><span class="line-number">889. </span>sad fits of crying, and throwing herself back, but <br id="n890" /><span class="line-number">890. </span>after once
                  or twice she became le<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s saucy, and <br id="n891" /><span class="line-number">891. </span>takes her food very pleasantly now. I think <br id="n892" /><span class="line-number">892. </span>she is
                  not a greedy child, whatever her other <br id="n893" /><span class="line-number">893. </span>faults may be. She knows when she has
                  had <br id="n894" /><span class="line-number">894. </span>enough. She gave me a very pretty little instance<br id="n895" /><span class="line-number">895. </span> of unselfishne<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s when we were last at Knutsford
                  <br id="n896" /><span class="line-number">896. </span>which pleased me very much. We were calling <br id="n897" /><span class="line-number">897. </span>at Mr<u>s</u>. Deanes who has
                  two children, one about <br id="n898" /><span class="line-number">898. </span>9 months older, the other about that much
                  <br id="n899" /><span class="line-number">899. </span>younger than Marianne. A few
                  comfits <br id="n900" /><span class="line-number">900. </span> were thrown on the carpet, which the youngest <br id="n901" /><span class="line-number">901. </span>child (little
                  Emily) could hardly manage to <br id="n902" /><span class="line-number">902. </span>pick
                  up. My own dear Marianne however
                  <br id="n903" /><span class="line-number">903. </span>did not put one into her own mouth, though <br id="n904" /><span class="line-number">904. </span>as fond of them as could be,
                  but crammed <br id="n905" /><span class="line-number">905. </span>them into little Emily.
                  It made my heart <br id="n906" /><span class="line-number">906. </span> glad.</p>
               
               <p><br id="n907" /><span class="line-number">907. </span>I am not aware that any promise <br id="n908" /><span class="line-number">908. </span>has been made to her that has not been

                  some <br id="n947" /><span class="line-number">947. </span>curiosity on the subject, Betsy injudiciously <br id="n948" /><span class="line-number">948. </span>but very naturally told her it was a poor

                  prompted her even then, <br id="n966" /><span class="line-number">966. </span>she peeped to me, saying "Ki<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s, Mama." <br id="n967" /><span class="line-number">967. </span>These are trifles but how very precious <br id="n968" /><span class="line-number">968. </span>may the

               <h2>Entry 7</h2>
               <h3>December 9, 1837</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  3 years, 3 months; Meta, aged 10
                  months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Thirteen months since the previous entry.</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: Twelve handwritten pages</h4>
               <p>The seventh entry spans twelve handwritten manuscript pages, one of the longest
                  entries in the diary. In this entry Gaskell introduces two new individuals; her second daughter,
                  Margaret Emily, called
                  <q>Meta</q>, and her maternal aunt, Gaskell’s adoptive
                  <q>more-than-mother</q>
                  Hannah Lumb. Aunt Lumb was a *widowed woman who raised
                  Gaskell after her
                  mother’s death when she
                  was only thirteen months old. Shortly following the birth of Meta, Aunt
                  Lumb suffered a stroke that marked the beginning of her final
                  illness. Marianne had been staying
                  with her at the time, during her mother’s confinement, and both Gaskell and one-month-old
                  Meta traveled to be with Marianne and Aunt Lumb early in March until her death
                  in May. These events, Meta’s birth and
                  Aunt Lumb’s death, are alluded
                  to by Gaskell early in the
                  entry, when she writes that “sad excuses” in some part account for the year-long
                  lapse between this diary entry and the one that preceded it. </p>
               <p>Much of the entry is told looking back on the months that have passed between the
                  entries, during which time Meta was born,
                  and Aunt Lumb passed away. The
                  events were closely connected, in fact; Marianne had gone to stay with Aunt Lumb had a paralytic stroke, and Gaskell traveled to
                  Knutsford, with newborn Meta and a servant, Betsy, and remained there in rented rooms with
                  both girls for nearly two months until Aunt
                  Lumb’s death on May 1st. A letter, dated 18
                  March 1837, recounts Gaskell’s experience of Aunt
                  Lumb’s illness. There is also a second letter, written to Holbrook Gaskell, tentatively dated in 1837
                  as Marianne is the only child
                  mentioned; part of the letter is missing. The letter details plans for the
                  possibility of negotiating a new servant.</p>
               <p>The diary entry looks back on these events and comments tenderly on Aunt Lumb’s care of both Marianne and Gaskell, and recounts Gaskell’s careful management of
                  the situation with Marianne, who
                  was not told that Aunt Lumb had
                  died. The later part of the entry discusses the differences between the two
                  sisters, commenting that Meta, already
                  ten months old, is livelier and physically developing earlier than Marianne, crawling “famously”. Marianne, to Gaskell’s pleasure, has a very
                  “acute” conscience, and is becoming “useful and independent,” often willing to
                  share with her sister and generally obedient and cheerful. Meta, however, is <q>saucy</q>,
                  <q>clever</q>, and <q>not so gentle</q> as her elder
                  sister.</p>

                  of doors; she had been about an hour <br id="n1030" /><span class="line-number">1030. </span>out, and said she was hastening home,
                  for she did <br id="n1031" /><span class="line-number">1031. </span>not think she had left M.
                  A. so long before; The little <br id="n1032" /><span class="line-number">1032. </span>girl slept in a cot by Aunt Lumb's bed; Aunt Lumb
                  <br id="n1033" /><span class="line-number">1033. </span>gave her, her breakfast, sitting on her knee, by a win=<br id="n1034" /><span class="line-number">1034. </span>=dow,
                  with many loving little jokes between them. <br id="n1035" /><span class="line-number">1035. </span>Aunt Lumb walked out with her, when the

               <p><br id="n1038" /><span class="line-number">1038. </span>The very day Aunt Lumb was
                  seized with her fatal <br id="page 52"><br />Page 52</br>

               <p><br id="n1042" /><span class="line-number">1042. </span>That evening about 1/2 past 10, she had a para=<br id="n1043" /><span class="line-number">1043. </span>=lytic stroke.
                  M.A. was as usual in her little
                  sofa <br id="n1044" /><span class="line-number">1044. </span>bed by Aunt Lumb's, and
                  remained there till <br id="n1045" /><span class="line-number">1045. </span>morning, when she wanted according to her custom <br id="n1046" /><span class="line-number">1046. </span>to
                  come into Aunt Lumb's bed. But
                  Aunt Lumb
                  <br id="n1047" /><span class="line-number">1047. </span>did not heed the little voice that kept petitioning <br id="n1048" /><span class="line-number">1048. </span>to be taken in, and
                  when they told her <q>Aunt Lumb
                     was poorly.</q> she kept saying <q>Aunt

               <p><br id="n1051" /><span class="line-number">1051. </span>We were confined to two little bed-rooms in that <br id="n1052" /><span class="line-number">1052. </span>unhappy eight weeks,
                  and the little girls could <br id="n1053" /><span class="line-number">1053. </span>hardly ever go out. But Marianne was a good <br id="n1054" /><span class="line-number">1054. </span>little comfort,
                  though in such trying circumstances <br id="n1055" /><span class="line-number">1055. </span>to a child's temper. Aunt Lumb asked to see <br id="n1056" /><span class="line-number">1056. </span>her, about a
                  week after her first seizure; and <br id="n1057" /><span class="line-number">1057. </span>I took MA in. But the room was darkened <br id="page 53"><br />Page 53</br><br id="n1058" /><span class="line-number">1058. </span>gloomy; Aunt Lumb had had leeches to her head
                  <br id="n1059" /><span class="line-number">1059. </span>and it was bound up, almost corpse-like, with <br id="n1060" /><span class="line-number">1060. </span>a handkerchief. Marianne was frightened I <br id="n1061" /><span class="line-number">1061. </span>think; and
                  I was afraid Aunt Lumb, though not
                  <br id="n1062" /><span class="line-number">1062. </span>herself, and blind, (alas!) perceived it. The next time <br id="n1063" /><span class="line-number">1063. </span>she begged to
                  have a night-cap put on, and had <br id="n1064" /><span class="line-number">1064. </span>a fig put behind her pillow, and M.A. was recon=<br id="n1065" /><span class="line-number">1065. </span>ciled, and
                  played about the room. She went in seve=<br id="n1066" /><span class="line-number">1066. </span>=ral times, and her coming
                  always gave Aunt <br id="n1067" /><span class="line-number">1067. </span>Lumb
                  pleasure. It was such a beautiful spring <br id="n1068" /><span class="line-number">1068. </span>morning, that 1<u>st</u> of May, when Aunt Lumb died; <br id="n1069" /><span class="line-number">1069. </span> such a contrast to
                  the dreary weather before.</p>
               
               <p><br id="n1070" /><span class="line-number">1070. </span>On the 3<u>rd</u> we all came back to Manchester; and <br id="n1071" /><span class="line-number">1071. </span>then I rather began to fear
                  that the long confine=<br id="n1072" /><span class="line-number">1072. </span>ment in small rooms had <u>told</u> upon Marianne's
                  <br id="n1073" /><span class="line-number">1073. </span>temper, poor darling! She was fretful, and rather <br id="n1074" /><span class="line-number">1074. </span>obstinate sometimes.
                  But Betsy was leaving us <br id="page 54"><br />Page 54</br><br id="n1075" /><span class="line-number">1075. </span>and a new servant coming, which I do think is <br id="n1076" /><span class="line-number">1076. </span>a trial for a child. It
                  soon wore off with patient; and <br id="n1077" /><span class="line-number">1077. </span>gentle treatment from her Aunt Eliza, who was <br id="n1078" /><span class="line-number">1078. </span>here at
                  the time, comforting and being of use. <br id="n1079" /><span class="line-number">1079. </span>We have never told her that Aunt Lumb was dead, <br id="n1080" /><span class="line-number">1080. </span>fearing that a

                  But I often talk <br id="n1083" /><span class="line-number">1083. </span>of her, and try to keep alive the recollection of her
                  <br id="n1084" /><span class="line-number">1084. </span>love and tenderne<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s, and show her Aunt

                  <br id="n1086" /><span class="line-number">1086. </span>for so chastened and pure a spirit) may stand <br id="n1087" /><span class="line-number">1087. </span>forth clear and distinct
                  among her childish remem=<br id="n1088" /><span class="line-number">1088. </span>=brances. One day we were talking, and
                  she said <q>Aunt <br id="n1089" /><span class="line-number">1089. </span>Lumb was
                     poorly;</q>
                  <q>No,</q> I said, <q>she is well and happy <br id="n1090" /><span class="line-number">1090. </span>now.</q> Is she, replied my dear
                  little girl, <q>Oh then <br id="n1091" /><span class="line-number">1091. </span>I am so glad; let me go and coax her.</q> And
                  <br id="n1092" /><span class="line-number">1092. </span>since she has been at Knutsford (in September)<br id="page 55"><br />Page 55</br><br id="n1093" /><span class="line-number">1093. </span>she has told me Aunt
                  Lumb did not live with <br id="n1094" /><span class="line-number">1094. </span>Aunt
                  Ab now; she had left that house. I longed to <br id="n1095" /><span class="line-number">1095. </span>say she was
                  <q>gone to a house not made with hands, <br id="n1096" /><span class="line-number">1096. </span>eternal, in the
                     heavens.</q> But I thought I had better <br id="n1097" /><span class="line-number">1097. </span>not, for to her it would have
                  been unintelligible at <br id="n1098" /><span class="line-number">1098. </span>present.
                  Before she went to
                  Knutsford in September, <br id="n1099" /><span class="line-number">1099. </span>she had again a few days of untractablene<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s, and obsti=<br id="n1100" /><span class="line-number">1100. </span>=nacy. But I think she was very judiciously
                  managed <br id="n1101" /><span class="line-number">1101. </span>while there, for she came back a good little darling, so <br id="n1102" /><span class="line-number">1102. </span>gentle
                  and loving. Indeed I should say that her <br id="n1103" /><span class="line-number">1103. </span>temper was very sweet, and her
                  disposition very <br id="n1104" /><span class="line-number">1104. </span>affectionate. Her little conscience too is becoming
                  <br id="n1105" /><span class="line-number">1105. </span>very acute and well-judging. I think most of her <br id="n1106" /><span class="line-number">1106. </span>faults are of

                  now and then when she has a fit of obsti=<br id="n1108" /><span class="line-number">1108. </span>=nacy; but we are very
                  steady in fulfilling our <u>threat</u><br id="page 56"><br />Page 56</br><br id="n1109" /><span class="line-number">1109. </span>of
                  punishment, so these little obstinacies are gradually <br id="n1110" /><span class="line-number">1110. </span>disappearing. Our
                  punishment for her is taking her <br id="n1111" /><span class="line-number">1111. </span>and leaving her alone for five minutes or
                  so, in a <br id="n1112" /><span class="line-number">1112. </span>light room. We tell her the length of time that she <br id="n1113" /><span class="line-number">1113. </span>may not
                  think we are influenced by caprice, or <br id="n1114" /><span class="line-number">1114. </span>that she gains her point (of leaving
                  the room) by <br id="n1115" /><span class="line-number">1115. </span>crying. Once and once only have we had recourse <br id="n1116" /><span class="line-number">1116. </span>to a
                  severer punishment. It was one Sunday <span class="choice"><span class="sic">eveng</span><span class="reg">evening</span></span>
                  <br id="n1117" /><span class="line-number">1117. </span>it may be about five weeks ago; we were trying to <br id="n1118" /><span class="line-number">1118. </span>teach her, her

She knew all the <br id="n1121" /><span class="line-number">1121. </span>vowels but refused to say A. All the
                  others she would <br id="n1122" /><span class="line-number">1122. </span>say, but would not even
                   repeat A after us. We <br id="n1123" /><span class="line-number">1123. </span>got the slate,
                  and drew it for her; but she persevered. <br id="n1124" /><span class="line-number">1124. </span>Meta was asleep so we were unwilling to provoke <br id="n1125" /><span class="line-number">1125. </span>the violent
                  crying, which generally ensues when <br id="n1126" /><span class="line-number">1126. </span>she is taken upstairs; so W<u>m</u>. gave her a slap

                  she refused to say it, till <br id="n1128" /><span class="line-number">1128. </span>at last she said it quite pat. Still I am sure we
                  <br id="n1129" /><span class="line-number">1129. </span>were so unhappy that we cried, when she was gone <br id="n1130" /><span class="line-number">1130. </span>to bed. And I don't
                  know if it was right. If not <br id="n1131" /><span class="line-number">1131. </span>pray, dear Marianne, forgive us.</p>
               
               <p><br id="n1132" /><span class="line-number">1132. </span>Since then we have not attempted any more le<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sons <br id="n1133" /><span class="line-number">1133. </span>till she shows some desire to resume them; and I <br id="n1134" /><span class="line-number">1134. </span>think she
                  is coming round, for she delights in <br id="n1135" /><span class="line-number">1135. </span>getting a book, and saying to herself,

                  any, even the most simple truths, of <br id="n1141" /><span class="line-number">1141. </span>religion. I am on the watch for any

                  fetching her Papa's <br id="n1146" /><span class="line-number">1146. </span>slippers &amp;c.
                  Today he was going out; and she had <br id="n1147" /><span class="line-number">1147. </span>gone on a me<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sage into the kitchen, but when <br id="n1148" /><span class="line-number">1148. </span>she heard him trying to open the

               <h2>Entry 8</h2>
               <h3>March 25, 1838</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  3 and a half; Meta, aged 13 months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Three and a half months since the previous entry.</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: Five and a half handwritten pages.</h4>
               <p>In the dateline of this entry, the year is obscured, so that an 8 is superimposed
                  over the seven. As the entry follows an entry for December
                  1837, however, and the entirety of the diary continues in chronological
                  sequence, it is clear that this entry was written in 1838. Although Meta is at this
                  time over a year old, Gaskell appears rushed in this entry and writes only about
                  Marianne, who is to begin
                  <q>Infant School</q>. Gaskell’s
                  maternal responsibility surrounding the education of her daughters is a fitting
                  topic in the wake of Queen Victoria’s
                  accession to the throne nine months earlier, in June
                  1837. The coronation had not yet taken place, but the country must have
                  been watching closely as they prepared for rule under a female monarch. The entry
                  foregrounds Gaskell’s
                  indecisiveness or doubt in maternal choices, and she uses the journal to weigh
                  both sides of the decision. On one hand, she worries, Marianne may learn things at school from
                  the other children that she would not wish her to know, and may care less for her
                  home, but on the other hand, Gaskell reasons, school will give her the opportunity to learn
                  obedience and perseverance, which are characteristics that Gaskell and her husband are firmly devoted to. They are not
                  concerned with Marianne’s learning
                  much in the school, so much as her developing the necessary habits that will
                  underly her learning later. </p>
               <p>The entry builds upon Gaskell’s concerns with Marianne’s education by discussing her initial mother-daughter
                  conversations regarding religious belief. Marianne has attended her first Chapel service, on Christmas Day in
                  1837, at age 3, and Gaskell is pleased with her
                  understanding of the teachings so far. Marianne’s language is developing; she knows her letters and can
                  spell a few words, and recite a poem. </p>
               <p>The entry’s closing allows an intriguing glimpse into the connections Gaskell makes between this early
                  diary and her later writing career. In the final paragraph, where she bemoans the
                  lack of time to write anything about Meta, Gaskell
                  writes pointedly, <q>I must devote my next ‘chapter’ to her.</q> This is
                  the first moment in the diary in which she likens her writing to its commercial
                  counterpart. This connection notably follows Gaskell’s first publication. The
                  previous year, in January 1837, only a month before
                  Meta’s birth, <q>Sketches Among
                     The Poor,</q> a poem co-written by the Gaskells, had appeared in
                  Blackwoods’. </p>

               <p><br id="n1197" /><span class="line-number">1197. </span>There is a new era in the little life of my dear <br id="n1198" /><span class="line-number">1198. </span>little girl. Tomorrow
                  she goes to an Infant School. <br id="n1199" /><span class="line-number">1199. </span>I think I am naturally
                  undecided, or rather <br id="n1200" /><span class="line-number">1200. </span>perhaps apt to repent my decision when it is <br id="n1201" /><span class="line-number">1201. </span>too
                  late, but now I am beginning to wonder if <br id="n1202" /><span class="line-number">1202. </span>I have done right about this
                  darling. There is <br id="n1203" /><span class="line-number">1203. </span>much to be said on each side. It <u>may</u> weaken <br id="n1204" /><span class="line-number">1204. </span>her pleasure in home, her love for us all, her
                  <br id="n1205" /><span class="line-number">1205. </span>confidence in me, at present such a ble<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sing <br id="n1206" /><span class="line-number">1206. </span>to me; - she <u>may</u> meet with children
                  who may <br id="n1207" /><span class="line-number">1207. </span>teach her the menaing of things of which at <br id="n1208" /><span class="line-number">1208. </span>present we desire to
                  keep her ignorant, that <br id="n1209" /><span class="line-number">1209. </span>we may give her correct ideas when her mind
                  <br id="n1210" /><span class="line-number">1210. </span>is more advanced; such as Death, falsehood <br id="n1211" /><span class="line-number">1211. </span>&amp;c &amp;c. But our
                  reasons for wishing her to go <br id="n1212" /><span class="line-number">1212. </span>to school, are also strong; not to advance her
                  <br id="page 62"><br />Page 62</br><br id="n1213" /><span class="line-number">1213. </span>rapidly in any branch of learning, for William

                  habits of obedience, to give her an idea <br id="n1216" /><span class="line-number">1216. </span>of conquering difficulties by
                  perseverance; and <br id="n1217" /><span class="line-number">1217. </span>to make her apply steadily for a short time. <br id="n1218" /><span class="line-number">1218. </span>She is to
                  go at half past nine, and come <br id="n1219" /><span class="line-number">1219. </span>home at 12; and certainly not in the after=<br id="n1220" /><span class="line-number">1220. </span>-noon at present, if ever. I think enough of <br id="n1221" /><span class="line-number">1221. </span>application may
                  be got in the morning, and <br id="n1222" /><span class="line-number">1222. </span>I shall like her to be with me, with Meta, <br id="n1223" /><span class="line-number">1223. </span>out of doors &amp;c &amp;c, in the
                  afternoon. I am <br id="n1224" /><span class="line-number">1224. </span>sometimes afraid of becoming a lazy <br id="n1225" /><span class="line-number">1225. </span>mother, willing to
                  send my children <br id="n1226" /><span class="line-number">1226. </span>away from me, and forgetting that on <u>me</u>
                  <br id="n1227" /><span class="line-number">1227. </span>lies the heaviest responsibility. I will try and <br id="n1228" /><span class="line-number">1228. </span>be better in this
                  respect. I intend as much <br id="n1229" /><span class="line-number">1229. </span>as I can, to fetch her from school myself; <br id="n1230" /><span class="line-number">1230. </span>I
                  have several reasons for wishing to do this. 
                  <br id="n1231" /><span class="line-number">1231. </span>One is that she may not be much out of school <br id="page 63"><br />Page 63</br><br id="n1232" /><span class="line-number">1232. </span>with the other
                  children, though I have reason <br id="n1233" /><span class="line-number">1233. </span>to believe them to be all respectable, and
                  well <br id="n1234" /><span class="line-number">1234. </span>brought up; but as she will be younger, she may <br id="n1235" /><span class="line-number">1235. </span>the more easily
                  catch up any false ideas. <br id="n1236" /><span class="line-number">1236. </span>Then I mean to lead her to tell me in the
                  <br id="n1237" /><span class="line-number">1237. </span>course of her walk home, all the little events <br id="n1238" /><span class="line-number">1238. </span>that have occurred in
                  school. I can perhaps <br id="n1239" /><span class="line-number">1239. </span>set her right if her ideas get confused, and I <br id="n1240" /><span class="line-number">1240. </span>can
                  sympathize with and advise her. <br id="n1241" /><span class="line-number">1241. </span>I have tried to decide in this matter for the
                  <br id="n1242" /><span class="line-number">1242. </span>best, and now we must await the result; only <br id="n1243" /><span class="line-number">1243. </span>pray for God's ble<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sing upon her.</p>
               
               <p>Since I last wrote, she and I have begun to <br id="n1244" /><span class="line-number">1244. </span>talk together about religion. I
                  have told <br id="n1245" /><span class="line-number">1245. </span>her the simple truths I thought she could <br id="n1246" /><span class="line-number">1246. </span>understand, such as
                  God's goodne<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s and love, <br id="n1247" /><span class="line-number">1247. </span>His watching over us in the silent hours of <br id="n1248" /><span class="line-number">1248. </span>the
                  night &amp;c. I think she has now right ideas <br id="page 64"><br />Page 64</br><br id="n1249" /><span class="line-number">1249. </span>as far as they go,
                  about this important subject. <br id="n1250" /><span class="line-number">1250. </span>At first she perplexed me very much by her
                  <br id="n1251" /><span class="line-number">1251. </span>very <u>material</u> questions. <q>When does
                      - go to <br id="n1252" /><span class="line-number">1252. </span>bed,</q> &amp;c. But now we talk
                  together in a low <br id="n1253" /><span class="line-number">1253. </span>tone, and she likes to hear about him, and refers <br id="n1254" /><span class="line-number">1254. </span>very
                  properly to him as the <q>Giver of every good <br id="n1255" /><span class="line-number">1255. </span>thing.</q> (Not her
                  words, of course.) Her Aunt Liz=<br id="n1256" /><span class="line-number">1256. </span>=zy is coming here soon, and tonight I told <br id="n1257" /><span class="line-number">1257. </span>her

                  she added <q>I shall ask God to keep

                  Christmas day, &amp; <br id="n1263" /><span class="line-number">1263. </span>was I think a little tired, though she
                  likes <br id="n1264" /><span class="line-number">1264. </span>much to talk about it.</p>
               
               <p>She has picked up all her large letters, <br id="n1265" /><span class="line-number">1265. </span>and can arrange them so as to make

               <p><br id="n1269" /><span class="line-number">1269. </span>Her temper continues liable to the same <br id="n1270" /><span class="line-number">1270. </span>fault obstinacy. In some moods

               <h2>Entry 9</h2>
               <h3>April 8, 1838</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  3 and a half; Meta, aged 14 months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Two weeks since the previous entry.</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: Four and two halves handwritten pages.</h4>
               <p>The ninth entry draws comparisons between the two daughters, and is particularly
                  concerned with health, and again, with the possibility of loss. Gaskell opens the entry by
                  recounting her fright at Marianne’s
                  recent <q>attack of croup,</q> which likely occurred only days after the
                  previous entry. This illness was deeply significant for Gaskell; it forms the primary
                  substance of a contemporaneous letter, dated March 30,
                  1838 to Eliza (Aunt Lizzy)
                  Gaskell, William Gaskell’s
                  then unmarried sister, and one of Gaskell’s most frequent early correspondents. Gaskell also comments
                  in both sources (diary and letter) about the death of Eddy Deane, whose father, Dr. Richard Deane, was Gaskell’s uncle Peter Holland’s partner in
                  Knutsford. Eddy
                  Deane was nine months older than Marianne and had been ill with croup the same night as Marianne and died four days later.
                  GGaskell interjects a
                  prayer for resignation into the account following this story. </p>
               <p>This entry marks another instance of Gaskell’s own rereading of her journal. As she turns from recording
                  Marianne’s illness to fulfill
                  her promise of devoting the next <q>chapter</q> to Meta, she writes <q>I have been amused on
                     looking at my former writing in this book to perceive the difference between
                     the two little girls.</q>
                  Gaskell has done this
                  before, commenting on her own perception of the diary as she rereads it before
                  continuing its composition.</p>
               <p>Gaskell continues with a
                  description of Marianne’s
                  development, much like those earlier in the diary for Marianne. Meta is independent, crawling and pulling herself up, playing and
                  making noise. She is more fretful than Marianne, and Gaskell reasserts her former <q>rules,</q> although in
                  Meta’s case, she fears that the servants are spoiling her rather than attending to
                  them. Meta eagerly wants what her sister
                  has, and according to the entry, eats nearly everything she is given as well. The
                  entry ends with a brief comment on the sisters’ relationship, this time worrying
                  that although they get along well, Marianne on occasion hurts Meta knowingly. The entry closes with another prayer for their
                  preservation, and a dash, perhaps indicating a hurried closing. </p>

               <h2>Entry 10</h2>
               <h3>October 14, 1838</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  4 years; Meta, aged 20 months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Six months since the previous entry.</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: Two handwritten pages.</h4>
               <p>This is the shortest entry in the diary, barely covering two handwritten pages. In
                  the entry which follows, Gaskell states that she had been interrupted when she last wrote,
                  which in part explains the brevity of this entry. Gaskell’s focus here is on
                  comparing her daughters; Meta once again
                  is described as <q>much the most energetic</q> and constantly
                  <q>busy</q>, whereas Gaskell worries that Marianne is not <q>industrious</q> and requires guidance to
                  keep busy. Marianne has improved
                  however, and Gaskell is
                  pleased to see that her former <q>obstinacy</q> is growing less frequent.
                  Even as she comments on her daughters’ achievements and cautiously observes their
                  faults, however, Gaskell
                  takes on herself the responsibility: <q>I am afraid I do not set her a good
                     example,</q> she writes of Marianne’s lack of initiative. In spite of this however, Marianne has begun to read and sew, though
                  she is only four years old. The entry ends rather abruptly after Gaskell asserts that she still
                  ascribes much of Marianne’s
                  behavior to physical complaints; she makes a consistent effort to keep her
                  <q>quiet, as otherwise she suffers much from exhaustion which shows itself
                     in increased irritability.</q> Here the entry ends.</p>
               <p>In the interim between this entry and the previous one, Queen Victoria’s coronation took place,
                  although there is no indication that the Gaskells were at all involved in the
                  festivities. An event more likely to have affected them was the formation of the
                  Anti-Corn Law Association in
                  Manchester, which was to become the Anti-Corn
                  Law League the following year. Two months before this entry,
                  Gaskell wrote a letter
                  to William Howitt in which she
                  described Clopton Hall,

                  sometimes in mischief to be sure, <br id="n1387" /><span class="line-number">1387. </span>but she is much the most energetic of the
                  two <br id="n1388" /><span class="line-number">1388. </span>sisters. I wish very much to make Marianne
                  <br id="n1389" /><span class="line-number">1389. </span>industrious; I am afraid I do not set her a <br id="n1390" /><span class="line-number">1390. </span>good example. I try to
                  employ her in making <br id="n1391" /><span class="line-number">1391. </span>candlelighters, printing pictures, counting out
                  <br id="n1392" /><span class="line-number">1392. </span>articles &amp;c, but she is soon tired of any <u>one</u>
                  <br id="n1393" /><span class="line-number">1393. </span>employment. This must be struggled against <br id="n1394" /><span class="line-number">1394. </span>for I can tell from
                  experience how increasing <br id="n1395" /><span class="line-number">1395. </span>an error this is. In temper and habits of obedience
                  <br id="n1396" /><span class="line-number">1396. </span>I think M. A. is much

               <h2>Entry 11</h2>
               <h3>October 28, 1838</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: Marianne, aged
                  four years; Meta, aged nearly 21
                  months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Two weeks since the previous entry.</h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: Four handwritten pages.</h4>
               <p>The final entry in the diary is still quite brief, although at the outset
                  Gaskell states that she
                  intends to <q>make up for</q> having been interrupted in the previous
                  entry. She continues to worry about Marianne’s health, and writes that they are traveling to
                  Prospect Hill, the home of a relative of William’s, south of
                  Warrington, on the recommendation of William’s brother,
                  Sam Gaskell, who was a physician and
                  seems to have been a frequent purveyor of medical advice to the family. Marianne is progressing in other respects,
                  as well, and has begun to have regular lessons at home in reading and sewing.
                  Gaskell prays for
                  patience in regulating her temper during these lessons. While she applauds
                  Marianne’s sympathy for others,
                  she is still concerned about what she believes is a lack of perseverance.
                  Meta, however, is generous, walked at
                  18 months, and is very energetic, even passionate at times. Just before closing,
                  Gaskell mentions that
                  Marianne has begun to eat
                  <q>animal food</q> now that she is four years old. The entry closes, as
                  most do, with a prayer, <q>May God bless both my dear children.</q>

                  tonight. Marianne and I <br id="n1411" /><span class="line-number">1411. </span>are
                  going in <sup>a</sup> day to Prospect Hill, on account of <br id="n1412" /><span class="line-number">1412. </span>her health;
                  she has grown very much lately, and <br id="n1413" /><span class="line-number">1413. </span>her Uncle
                  Sam thinks it desirable for her to have a <br id="n1414" /><span class="line-number">1414. </span>little change of air
                  before winter sets in. I hope <br id="n1415" /><span class="line-number">1415. </span>it will do her good, but there are so many
                  things <br id="n1416" /><span class="line-number">1416. </span>in another person's house that one cannot regulate <br id="n1417" /><span class="line-number">1417. </span>(meals,
                  temperature &amp;c) that I feel a little anxious. <br id="n1418" /><span class="line-number">1418. </span>I think I did not mention
                  in my last account <br id="n1419" /><span class="line-number">1419. </span>that, since she was four years old (Sep 12) she has <br id="page 74"><br />Page 74</br><br id="n1420" /><span class="line-number">1420. </span>begun to have regular
                  little le<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sons; before that time <br id="n1421" /><span class="line-number">1421. </span>indeed she had learnt her letters, partly in
                  play.- <br id="n1422" /><span class="line-number">1422. </span>She began with one word a day, in <q>Mama's le<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sons,</q>
                  <br id="n1423" /><span class="line-number">1423. </span>but as of course it was one <u>new</u> word, she now
                  <br id="n1424" /><span class="line-number">1424. </span>sometimes reads nearly a line. She seems to like <br id="n1425" /><span class="line-number">1425. </span>it and takes pains.
                  Sometimes in her sewing <br id="n1426" /><span class="line-number">1426. </span>le<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sons (of six stitches in seaming). I fear I am not <br id="n1427" /><span class="line-number">1427. </span>patient enough.
                  Oh God, in whose hands are all <br id="n1428" /><span class="line-number">1428. </span>hearts make me
                  more even-tempered. With her <br id="n1429" /><span class="line-number">1429. </span>I do try a great deal, but Oh my Father help me <br id="n1430" /><span class="line-number">1430. </span>to regulate my impatient temper
                  better!</p>
               
               <p><br id="n1431" /><span class="line-number">1431. </span>She is a most sympathetic little thing. She tries <br id="n1432" /><span class="line-number">1432. </span>so to comfort me if
                  she sees me looking sad, <br id="n1433" /><span class="line-number">1433. </span>or thinks that anything has happened to dis=<br id="n1434" /><span class="line-number">1434. </span>=comfort me. <span class="longspace">    
                     </span>Her great faults are unaccountable

                  this <br id="n1442" /><span class="line-number">1442. </span>observance, but I thought it desirable to lead her <br id="n1443" /><span class="line-number">1443. </span>to something
                  beyond the visible and material, and <br id="n1444" /><span class="line-number">1444. </span>some day I hope more interest will be
                  shown as to

I sometimes fear <br id="n1448" /><span class="line-number">1448. </span>this service is
                  too long for her, but I think she likes <br id="n1449" /><span class="line-number">1449. </span>coming in, though at first we had a

               <p><br id="n1452" /><span class="line-number">1452. </span>As to dear little Meta, she is
                  totally different <br id="n1453" /><span class="line-number">1453. </span>from Marianne though very like her in person. <br id="n1454" /><span class="line-number">1454. </span>She is a more popular
                  character: very lively, <br id="n1455" /><span class="line-number">1455. </span>enjoying a joke, always busy for herself; but
                  <br id="n1456" /><span class="line-number">1456. </span>she is pa<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sionate and wilful, though less so I <br id="n1457" /><span class="line-number">1457. </span>think than she was. She is a

                  eatables. <br id="n1459" /><span class="line-number">1459. </span>Not <u>so</u> generous as to her
                  play-things, but often very
                  <br id="n1460" /><span class="line-number">1460. </span>good about that. She has many engaging ways, <br id="n1461" /><span class="line-number">1461. </span>ki<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sing if she thinks she has offended or hurt in <br id="n1462" /><span class="line-number">1462. </span>any way. She is very
                  backward in her talking, - <br id="n1463" /><span class="line-number">1463. </span>Tata being the only word she can say - with an
                  <br id="n1464" /><span class="line-number">1464. </span>attempt at <q>please</q>. But she understands and notices <br id="n1465" /><span class="line-number">1465. </span>every word
                  that is spoken before her, and makes <br id="n1466" /><span class="line-number">1466. </span>herself understood too by signs and
                  noises. She <br id="n1467" /><span class="line-number">1467. </span>has walked this two months, being a very good <br id="n1468" /><span class="line-number">1468. </span>walker at 18
                  months. She has just cut her last <br id="n1469" /><span class="line-number">1469. </span>eye-tooth, and I am glad that trial is over
