                     cries and demands, and developmental milestones like learning to walk. This keen
                     awareness of motherhood is marked by self-doubt and an equally pronounced sense of

                     remains from the lower section of the page, are all fragments of the second diary

                              apparent that the strikethrough, which Gaskell usually writes as a horizontally
                              squiggly line, is passing through <q>we</q>. I have chosen to transcribe the
                              word "we", as did Joanne Shattock in her 2006 edition. This change is
                              consistent with Gaskell’s writing throughout the journal; she critiques herself
                              frequently, and comments on the responsibility which weighs heavily on her as a
                              mother. Changing the pronoun to “we” would have been an uncharacteristically
                              public gesture, given the context in which it occurs. </i></span> could <br id="n255" /><span class="line-number">255. </span>but

                              contains the most widely referenced Nativity account. Although Christmas is in
                              December, the reading may have appeared in February in conjunction with
                              Candlemas, which occurs on February 2nd. Candlemas is a Feast of the
                              Purification of Mary and also the Presentation of Jesus in the temple (40 days
                              following the birth of a son, the child was brought to the temple and a
                              sacrifice made for purification of the mother). Interestingly, nearly all
                              translations of this text refer to Mary by name, but Gaskell chooses here the
                              term “mother” instead, emphasizing the relationship. She is relating to Mary in

                              firsthand, having lost her first daughter due to stillbirth fourteen months
                              before Marianne’s birth. This draws in part from the sermon text earlier in the
