                     to writing about her own maternal choices - in this case, particularly her plans

                     cries and demands, and developmental milestones like learning to walk. This keen
                     awareness of motherhood is marked by self-doubt and an equally pronounced sense of
                     self-judgment stemming from Victorian assumptions about maternal duty. <span class="pIndex">Gaskell</span><span class="pi-note">Elizabeth Gaskell, the author of the journal, was born in 1810 and died in

                     remains from the lower section of the page, are all fragments of the second diary

                              This change is consistent with Gaskell’s writing throughout the journal; she critiques
                              herself frequently, and comments on the responsibility which weighs heavily on her

                              quoting from Luke 2:19. The reference is to Mary, the mother of Jesus; Luke 2
                              contains the most widely referenced Nativity account. Although Christmas is in
                              December, the reading may have appeared in February in conjunction with
                              Candlemas, which occurs on February 2nd. Candlemas is a Feast of the
                              Purification of Mary and also the Presentation of Jesus in the temple (40 days
                              following the birth of a son, the child was brought to the temple and a
                              sacrifice made for purification of the mother). Interestingly, nearly all
                              translations of this text refer to Mary by name, but Gaskell chooses here the
                              term “mother” instead, emphasizing the relationship. She is relating to Mary in
                              her role.</i></span> Oh! how very, very <br id="n668" /><span class="line-number">668. </span>true it is - and I sometimes think I

                              firsthand, having lost her first daughter due to stillbirth fourteen months
                              before Marianne’s birth. This draws in part from the sermon text earlier in the
                              entry, wherein Mary is treasuring memories of Christ’s childhood in the way
                              that a mother collects memories and experiences, and simultaneously expects it.

                        heart of the Industrial Revolution, and many of Gaskell's novels feature
                        factory workers or the poor, drawing on her observations there. Daughters

                        Plymouth Grove, until their deaths. The home has now been turned into the
