               <h3> March 10, 1835</h3>
               <h4>Children's Ages: <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>, aged
                  6 months</h4>
               <h4>Elapsed Time: Not applicable </h4>
               <h4>Length of Entry: 10 handwritten pages</h4>
            </header>
            <div class="headnote-text">
               <p>In this first entry, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> devotes a lengthy portion of her narrative (3 full pages)
                  to writing about her own maternal choices - in this case, particularly her plans
                  for handling common parenting concerns, including bedtimes, how to respond to
                  cries and demands, and developmental milestones like learning to walk. This keen
                  awareness of motherhood is marked by self-doubt and an equally pronounced sense of
                  self-judgment stemming from Victorian assumptions about maternal duty. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> uses the diary as a means
                  to check her own maternal behaviors, writing: <q>though I keep laying down
                     rules, I fear I have not sufficiently attended to them, though I hope I have
                     been conscientious hitherto in discharging my duty to her.</q> These rules
                  draw in part on educational treatises of the day; in this entry she cites a text
                  by the French authoress <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Madame Necker
                     DeSaussure</span>. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s conclusions, however, are more rigid for herself than for
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>. While insisting that
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> not be pressured into
                  walking or learning anything before she is ready, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> repeatedly reinforces her
                  commitment to her own duty to raise <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> according to strict principles, such as telling her
                  nothing but the absolute truth and selflessly placing her own needs after those of
                  her daughter.</p>
               <p>The dedication itself, where <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> hopes the diary <q>will be reserved for [<span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>] as a token of her mother’s
                     love and extreme anxiety in the formation of her little daughter’s
                     character,</q> demonstrates even at the outset the depth of introspection
                  that <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> associates
                  with the diary form, and with this manuscript in particular. Although undertaken
                  to record <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s
                  <q>character in it’s earliest form</q>, the diary is ostensibly also a
                  record of Gaskell’s own maternal anxieties, and in being so, it is also suggests
                  her fears of maternal mortality, which echo as an underlying theme throughout the
                  diary, both in her repeated fears of loss and in her inclusion of prayers for her
                  daughters’ safety. The brief <q>God bless her</q> that closes this entry
                  marks a tendency to conclude her entries with prayers for her daughters’ health
                  and safety that continues throughout the diary. At all times, the relationship
                  between mother and daughters is colored by a pervasive fear of death. </p>
               <p><span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s first entry is
                  slightly over ten handwritten pages, and was likely written on the same date as
                  the dedication; the handwriting is similar in size, saturation and ink color.
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> appears to have
                  often written in the evenings when her children were in bed; this and several
                  other entries indicate <q>evening</q> in the dateline. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> writes in this entry
                  about <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s bedtime routine;
                  she was laid down awake, at 6pm every evening, and since the entry concludes with
                  a comment about listening to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s restful breathing during the time of writing, it seems
                  likely that this entry was written sometime after 6 pm.</p>

                     disposition &amp;c. already; which I <br id="n27" /><span class="line-number">27. </span>can not now remember clearly. I will
                     <br id="n28" /><span class="line-number">28. </span>try and describe her mentally. I should <br id="n29" /><span class="line-number">29. </span>call
                     her remarkably good-tempered; though <br id="n30" /><span class="line-number">30. </span>at times she gives way to little bursts
                     <br id="n31" /><span class="line-number">31. </span>of passion or perhaps impatience would <br id="n32" /><span class="line-number">32. </span>be the right name. She is also
                     very firm <br id="n33" /><span class="line-number">33. </span>in her own little way occasionally; what <br id="n34" /><span class="line-number">34. </span>I suppose is
                     obstinacy really, only that <br id="n35" /><span class="line-number">35. </span> is so hard a word to apply to one so <br id="n36" /><span class="line-number">36. </span>dear.
                     But in general she is so good <br id="n37" /><span class="line-number">37. </span> that I feel as if I could hardly be
                     <br id="n38" /><span class="line-number">38. </span>sufficiently thankful, that the materials <br id="n39" /><span class="line-number">39. </span>put into my hands are so

                     day <br id="n55" /><span class="line-number">55. </span>more and more interesting. She looks at <br id="n56" /><span class="line-number">56. </span>and tries to take hold of
                     every thing. She <br id="n57" /><span class="line-number">57. </span>has pretty good ideas of distance and does <br id="n58" /><span class="line-number">58. </span>not try to
                     catch sunbeams now, as she <span class="figure"><img class="page" id="page-4" src="?????.jpg" alt="photo facsimile page 4" /><span class="caption">Page 4</span></span>
                     <br id="n59" /><span class="line-number">59. </span>did two months ago. Her sense of sight <br id="n60" /><span class="line-number">60. </span>is much improved lately in seeing
                     objects <br id="n61" /><span class="line-number">61. </span>at a distance, and distinguishing them. <br id="n62" /><span class="line-number">62. </span>For instance I had her

                     <br id="n64" /><span class="line-number">64. </span>was going out of the gate; and she evi=<br id="n65" /><span class="line-number">65. </span>=dently knew him;

                     do so to her <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Papa</span>. She catches <br id="n70" /><span class="line-number">70. </span>the

                     every word. I try always <br id="n77" /><span class="line-number">77. </span>to let her look at any thing which at=<br id="n78" /><span class="line-number">78. </span>=tracts her notice as long as she will<span class="figure"><img class="page" id="page-5" src="?????.jpg" alt="photo facsimile page 5" /><span class="caption">Page 5</span></span>
                     <br id="n79" /><span class="line-number">79. </span>and when I see her looking very intently <br id="n80" /><span class="line-number">80. </span>at <span class="choice"><span class="sic">any thing[sic]</span><span class="reg">anything</span></span>, I take her to it, and let <br id="n81" /><span class="line-number">81. </span>her exercise all her senses upon

                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s accomplishments and
                  fearing her loss. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>
                  has carefully delineated her objectives for raising <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>, many of which emphasize allowing
                  her to develop and learn at her own pace. To this end, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> recounts that <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> recognizes many words and
                  individuals, but does not walk or talk. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> also continues with the
                  theme of maternal responsibility, her asserting rules that she <q>tr[ies] to
                     attend to &amp; make the servants attend to</q>. The cheerful mood that
                  begins the entry fades as <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> reflects on an attack of croup from which <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> has recently recovered. She
                  recounts her fear of losing her daughter, which was no doubt strengthened by the
                  memory of the stillbirth of her firstborn daughter fourteen months before
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s birth. <span class="ref" id="ref-2">2</span><span class="ed-note" id="note-2"><i>Note: (Resp:#mjk)
                        The stillbirth occurred in July of
                        1833; at the time of this entry it had been just over two years since
                        this loss.</i></span> The fear is quite poignant for <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>, and she copies a portion
                  of a poem by <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Caroline Bowles</span>,
                  <q>To A Dying Infant</q>, which was frequently used as a Victorian
                  epitaph. The entry includes a prayer of thankfulness that <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> was spared, which falls in this
                  case mid-entry. </p>
               <p>This is the only entry in the diary to have a significant portion of the text
                  missing. The top third of the second page has been removed, presumably cut because
                  the edge of the remaining page is smooth. The second page [recto] shows marks
                  where a small 2-3 fragment of the page is still attached to the binding of the
                  codex. Given the typical spacing of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s handwritten lines, her habit of noting words broken
                  across the lines with equal signs, and the number and placement of the extant
                  marks on the fragment, we can assume that approximately six lines of text are
                  missing on the recto side of the page, and 5-6 lines on the verso. We can surmise
                  that the all of the text on the surrounding pages, together with the section that
                  remains from the lower section of the page, are all fragments of the second diary
                  entry, and that the lost sections did not include the start or endpoint of another
                  diary entry. This is clear because the following (third) entry, dated October fourth 1835, begins, <q>I see it is
                     exactly two months since I last wrote in this book,</q> which indicates
                  that this second entry, dated August 4th, is the
                  one immediately preceding it.</p>

                  13 months</h4>

               <p>At the time she wrote this entry, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> was the same age that <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> herself had been when she
                  lost her own mother. The entry is preoccupied with <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s observations and
                  decisions related to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s
                  physical health. She introduces her belief that in children, <q>every change
                     of temper might be deduced from some corresponding change in the body.</q>
                  She cites <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Combe</span>’s
                  Physiology as one source of this conviction and describes in
                  detail <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s temperament. In
                  addition to offering examples of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s <q>self-government</q> and her improvement in
                  patience, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> also
                  lays out again her mother-rules for raising <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>. Due to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s fragility, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> plans to dress her warmly and keep her indoors during the
                  winter, and she has stopped feeding <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> milk, believing that thickened broth is a more
                  <q>strengthening</q> food. The entry concludes with a lengthy prayer
                  asking not only for <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s
                  health, but for <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s
                  own strength in the event that she should lose her only daughter.</p>

               <p><span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> continues
                  describing <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s development
                  and her own convictions about parenting in this entry. According to the
                  descriptions given here, the Gaskells were still calling <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>
                  <q>baby</q>. She would be an only child until 1837. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> both celebrates behaviors
                  that she interprets as the beginning of self-government, while also commenting at
                  length on <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s recovery from
                  an illness that is recounted in the previous entry. She mentions throughout
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s personality- that she
                  recognizes family, will share food, rarely cries, etc., and mentions her growing
                  vocabulary and general observation and attentiveness. Throughout the entry, in
                  addition to learning more about <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> - she still does not walk, and is still living on
                  thickened broth, which <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> believes has improved her health - we continue to learn
                  more about <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s
                  maternal instincts. She is deeply self-critical and sets high standards for
                  herself. In the opening of the entry, she criticizes herself for not having
                  written sooner, although it has been only two months since the previous entry. She
                  also claims that she <q>ought not</q> to be negligent in any regard toward
                  her daughter, including in this instance, in writing about her in the journal. Of
                  particular note in this entry is the penultimate sentence, in which <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> writes, <q>I feel
                     weak &amp; exhausted with writing, or I had meant to write more.</q> This
                  admission, in addition to underscoring the duty <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> feels to keep the diary,
                  foregrounds the weight which maternal writing held for <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>. This writing is not
                  merely record keeping or reflection; it is a deeply personal, emotionally invested
                  act which requires energy of the author. Even paper motherhood is taxing. The
                  entry, as many do, ends with a prayer, asking a blessing upon <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>, and help for <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> as she fulfils her sense
                  of duty.</p>

            </header>
            <div class="headnote-text">
               <p>Although this is not the last entry in which <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> writes only about
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>, it is the last one in
                  which she has only one child. By the date of the following entry, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> was already expecting her
                  second daughter, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Margaret Emily (called Meta)
                     </span>. Six of the eleven journal entries, including this one, are written on
                  Sundays, usually in the evenings. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> opens this entry with a recollection of the sermon text,
                  drawn from the Christmas narrative in Luke, which
                  mentions a mother treasuring memory of her son <span class="ref" id="ref-7">7</span><span class="ed-note" id="note-7"><i>Note: (Resp:)
                        See textual note regarding
                        the placement of this reading in February</i></span>. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> connects the text with
                  her own maternal practice of actively seeking to remember her children, and
                  specifically credits her diary-keeping practice: <q>I sometimes think I may
                     find this little journal a great help in recalling the memory of my darling
                     child if we should lose her.</q></p>
               <p>After this rather melancholy opening, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> goes on to record <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s development according to her custom: first physical
                  development, and then social and emotional. Between the lines of the text,
                  however, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> has
                  inscribed another record, the record of her own re-reading of the journal. Beyond
                  merely suggesting that rereading the journal <q>would</q> be helpful in
                  the instance of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s death,
                  Gaskell actually rereads her diary while she is living, as indicated by the
                  sentence, <q>I see I have generally begun my journal with describing the
                     bodily progress she has made, and I will keep to the proper order of
                     things.</q> Thus, even in writing the diary itself, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> is prescribing and
                  following maternal rules. The diary too, must follow a carefully planned form in
                  order to be successful. It must be <q>proper</q>.</p>
               <p><span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> is on the whole
                  pleased with <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s development
                  here, claiming that her personality promises to be affectionate and pleasant,
                  although she bemoans her disobedience. The remaining diary entry emphasizes
                  obedience on two levels: <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s

                  prays for help to control herself, particularly for her daughter. She “intends”
                  herself to be patient, just as she <q>intends</q>
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> to be independent, and as
                  in much of the journal, she takes the responsibility herself, though calling on a

                           Gaskell is quoting from Luke 2:19. The reference is to Mary, the mother of Jesus;
                           Luke 2 contains the most widely referenced Nativity account. Although Christmas is
                           in December, the reading may have appeared in February in conjunction with Candlemas,
                           which occurs on February 2nd. Candlemas is a Feast of the Purification of Mary and
                           also the Presentation of Jesus in the temple (40 days following the birth of a son,
                           the child was brought to the temple and a sacrifice made for purification of the mother).
                           Interestingly, nearly all translations of this text refer to Mary by name, but Gaskell
                           chooses here the term “mother” instead, emphasizing the relationship. She is relating
                           to Mary in her role.</i></span> Oh! how very, very <br id="n668" /><span class="line-number">668. </span>true it is

                           This marks the first clearly identified moment in which Gaskell is rereading the diary,
                           looking back and seeing what she has “generally” done structurally in her entries,
                           and promising to continue this “proper order” which she has set for herself.</i></span></p>

                           3-4 characters in length, has not been identified by previous editors. Clement
                           Shorter in his 1923 edition, and Anita Wilson and J.A.V. Chapple in their 1996
                           edition, both silently delete this word, presumably because it does not appear

               <p>The sixth entry foregrounds <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s belief that <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s behavior is heavily dependent upon and affected by her
                  physiological status. She follows her established pattern, beginning with a
                  description of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s physical
                  development, followed by her intellectual and moral development. The entry’s
                  physical description surrounds <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s learning to walk, which she did at the late age of 22
                  months old. According to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>, upon the advice of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Dr.
                     Richard Deane</span>, a partner in her Uncle <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Peter Holland</span>’s medical practice in <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Knutsford</span>, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>
                  was kept from being put on her feet during a summer visit in 1836, when she would
                  have been nearly 21 months old. Following a “violent attack” which the Gaskells
                  treated with a warm bath and a dose of castor oil, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> cut her eye teeth, and
                  subsequently <q>began almost suddenly to walk.</q> The narrative of this
                  milestone step exemplifies <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s attitudes toward development throughout the diary: while
                  eager to see <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s
                  achievements, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>
                  insists on letting her daughters develop at their own pace, and concerns herself
                  primarily with helping <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> to
                  develop habits of perseverance and patience, rather than insisting on her gaining
                  any particular knowledge or skills.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the diary entry emphasizes <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s intellectual and moral development; she enjoys stories
                  and chatters often, but <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>, as with walking, intends to wait on formal instruction
                  until <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> is over 3 years old.
                  She is pleased with her daughter’s awareness of right and wrong, commenting that
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> often talks to herself
                  about being a <q>dood dirl</q> [good girl], and even recording a situation
                  in which she observed an adult engaged in something wrong and told her mother
                  about it. Although she shows evident pleasure in <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s growth, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> again closes the entry
                  with anxious maternal worries. Recalling the unexpected death of an acquaintance’s
                  only child, she concludes with the observation of <q>how very precious may the
                     remembrance of [events recorded in the journal] become,</q> and a prayer
                  for her strength and resignation in the face of possible loss. </p>

                     and the consequence of course was that <br id="n788" /><span class="line-number">788. </span>she lost the little idea of walking
                     which she <br id="n789" /><span class="line-number">789. </span>had before. At <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Prospect

                     (beginning <br id="n791" /><span class="line-number">791. </span>with violent screaming as if in pain), but <br id="n792" /><span class="line-number">792. </span> we put her
                     directly into warm water, &amp; <br id="n793" /><span class="line-number">793. </span>gave her castor oil, sending at the same

                     body <br id="n796" /><span class="line-number">796. </span>was owing to being on the point of <br id="n797" /><span class="line-number">797. </span>cutting her eye-teeth. He said

                     months old, she began <br id="n804" /><span class="line-number">804. </span>almost suddenly to walk by herself, and <br id="n805" /><span class="line-number">805. </span>since then
                     her bodily strength has come on <br id="n806" /><span class="line-number">806. </span>very much indeed. For some time, indeed
                     <br id="n807" /><span class="line-number">807. </span>even now we are very careful to comply with <br id="n808" /><span class="line-number">808. </span>her request to be taken "up,

                     such a pleasurable feeling, that it <br id="n811" /><span class="line-number">811. </span>must be fatigue and not caprice that lead
                     <br id="n812" /><span class="line-number">812. </span>her to ask to be carried. She is very careful <br id="n813" /><span class="line-number">813. </span>and has a good idea of
                     danger; not like <br id="n814" /><span class="line-number">814. </span>some children who have been forced rather <br id="n815" /><span class="line-number">815. </span>too early to

                  <p>She is a famous chatter-box seldom letting <br id="n827" /><span class="line-number">827. </span>her little tongue rest either with

                     amusing to hear her talk <br id="n829" /><span class="line-number">829. </span>in this latter fashion, inventing so many new

                     lately, who said that till <br id="n839" /><span class="line-number">839. </span>the age of three years or there abouts, the brain

                     connected with her physical <br id="n861" /><span class="line-number">861. </span>state that has in some measure accounted <br id="n862" /><span class="line-number">862. </span>for

                     one, in <br id="n889" /><span class="line-number">889. </span>anger did what was decidedly wrong in her
                     <br id="n890" /><span class="line-number">890. </span>presence, without considering how holy that <br id="n891" /><span class="line-number">891. </span>little creature made the
                     place. She took no <br id="n892" /><span class="line-number">892. </span>notice, at the time but the next morning <br id="n893" /><span class="line-number">893. </span>told me of

                     interested in preserving her love and <br id="n895" /><span class="line-number">895. </span>re<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ[sic]</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>pect for the person to whom I allude, I <br id="n896" /><span class="line-number">896. </span>knew it was my duty not to
                     weaken her <br id="n897" /><span class="line-number">897. </span>power of discriminating, &amp; said <q>it was very <br id="n898" /><span class="line-number">898. </span>naughty,

                     <br id="n899" /><span class="line-number">899. </span>A few weeks ago she got a habit of refusing <br id="n900" /><span class="line-number">900. </span>her food, saying
                     <q>bye-bye</q> &amp;c when a spoon=<br id="n901" /><span class="line-number">901. </span>=ful was offered to her which she did
                     not <br id="n902" /><span class="line-number">902. </span>quite approve. I found the best plan was <br id="n903" /><span class="line-number">903. </span>to take her at her word,
                     and quietly sent <br id="n904" /><span class="line-number">904. </span>the plate away, which at first produed <span class="figure"><img class="page" id="page-46" src="?????.jpg" alt="photo facsimile page 46" /><span class="caption">Page 46</span></span><br id="n905" /><span class="line-number">905. </span>sad

I think <br id="n908" /><span class="line-number">908. </span>she is
                     not a greedy child, whatever her other <br id="n909" /><span class="line-number">909. </span>faults may be. She knows when she has
                     had <br id="n910" /><span class="line-number">910. </span>enough.

                     <br id="n919" /><span class="line-number">919. </span>did not put one into her own mouth, though <br id="n920" /><span class="line-number">920. </span>as fond of them as could be,

               <p>The seventh entry spans twelve handwritten manuscript pages, one of the longest
                  entries in the diary. In this entry <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> introduces two new individuals; her second daughter,
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Margaret Emily</span>, called
                  <q>Meta</q>, and her maternal aunt, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s adoptive
                  <q>more-than-mother</q>
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Hannah Lumb</span>. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt Lumb</span> was a *widowed woman who raised
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> after her
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>mother</span>’s death when she
                  was only thirteen months old. Shortly following the birth of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span>, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt
                     Lumb</span> suffered a stroke that marked the beginning of her final
                  illness. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> had been staying
                  with her at the time, during her <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>mother</span>’s confinement, and both <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> and one-month-old
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span> traveled to be with <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> and <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt Lumb</span> early in March until her death
                  in May. These events, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span>’s birth and
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt Lumb</span>’s death, are alluded
                  to by <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> early in the
                  entry, when she writes that “sad excuses” in some part account for the year-long
                  lapse between this diary entry and the one that preceded it. </p>
               <p>Much of the entry is told looking back on the months that have passed between the
                  entries, during which time <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span> was born,
                  and <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt Lumb</span> passed away. The
                  events were closely connected, in fact; <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> had gone to stay with <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt Lumb</span> had a paralytic stroke, and <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> traveled to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Knutsford</span>, with newborn <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span> and a servant, Betsy, and remained there in
                  rented rooms with both girls for nearly two months until <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt Lumb</span>’s death on May 1st. A letter,
                  dated 18 March 1837, recounts <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s experience of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt Lumb</span>’s illness. There is also a
                  second letter, written to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Holbrook
                     Gaskell</span>, tentatively dated in 1837 as <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> is the only child mentioned; part
                  of the letter is missing. The letter details plans for the possibility of
                  negotiating a new servant.</p>
               <p>The diary entry looks back on these events and comments tenderly on <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt Lumb</span>’s care of both <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> and <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>, and recounts <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s careful management of
                  the situation with <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>, who
                  was not told that <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Aunt Lumb</span> had
                  died. The later part of the entry discusses the differences between the two
                  sisters, commenting that <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span>, already
                  ten months old, is livelier and physically developing earlier than <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>, crawling “famously”. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>, to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s pleasure, has a very
                  “acute” conscience, and is becoming “useful and independent,” often willing to
                  share with her sister and generally obedient and cheerful. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span>, however, is <q>saucy</q>,
                  <q>clever</q>, and <q>not so gentle</q> as her elder
                  sister.</p>

                     Before she went to
                     <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Knutsford</span> in September, <br id="n1118" /><span class="line-number">1118. </span>she had again a few days of untractablene<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ[sic]</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s, and obsti=<br id="n1119" /><span class="line-number">1119. </span>=nacy.

                     <br id="n1124" /><span class="line-number">1124. </span>very acute and well-judging. I think most of her <br id="n1125" /><span class="line-number">1125. </span>faults are of

                     so, in a <br id="n1131" /><span class="line-number">1131. </span>light room. We tell her the length of time that she <br id="n1132" /><span class="line-number">1132. </span>may not

               <p>In the dateline of this entry, the year is obscured, so that an 8 is superimposed
                  over the seven. As the entry follows an entry for December
                  1837, however, and the entirety of the diary continues in chronological
                  sequence, it is clear that this entry was written in 1838. Although <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span> is at this
                  time over a year old, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> appears rushed in this entry and writes only about
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>, who is to begin
                  <q>Infant School</q>. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s maternal responsibility surrounding the education of her
                  daughters is a fitting topic in the wake of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Queen
                     Victoria</span>’s accession to the throne nine months earlier, in June 1837. The coronation had not yet taken place, but
                  the country must have been watching closely as they prepared for rule under a
                  female monarch. The entry foregrounds <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s indecisiveness or doubt in maternal choices, and she uses
                  the journal to weigh both sides of the decision. On one hand, she worries,
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> may learn things at
                  school from the other children that she would not wish her to know, and may care
                  less for her home, but on the other hand, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> reasons, school will give
                  her the opportunity to learn obedience and perseverance, which are characteristics
                  that <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> and her
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>husband</span> are firmly devoted to. They are
                  not concerned with <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s
                  learning much in the school, so much as her developing the necessary habits that
                  will underly her learning later. </p>
               <p>The entry builds upon <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s concerns with <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s education by discussing her initial mother-daughter
                  conversations regarding religious belief. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> has attended her first Chapel service, on Christmas Day in
                  1837, at age 3, and <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> is pleased with her
                  understanding of the teachings so far. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s language is developing; she knows her letters and can
                  spell a few words, and recite a poem. </p>
               <p>The entry’s closing allows an intriguing glimpse into the connections <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> makes between this early
                  diary and her later writing career. In the final paragraph, where she bemoans the
                  lack of time to write anything about <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span>, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>
                  writes pointedly, <q>I must devote my next ‘chapter’ to her.</q> This is
                  the first moment in the diary in which she likens her writing to its commercial
                  counterpart. This connection notably follows <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s first publication. The
                  previous year, in January 1837, only a month before
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span>’s birth, <q>Sketches Among
                     The Poor,</q> a poem co-written by the Gaskells, had appeared in Blackwoods’. </p>

                     when it is <br id="n1220" /><span class="line-number">1220. </span>too late, but now I am beginning to wonder if <br id="n1221" /><span class="line-number">1221. </span>I have done
                     right about this darling. There is <br id="n1222" /><span class="line-number">1222. </span>much to be said on each side. It may weaken <br id="n1223" /><span class="line-number">1223. </span>her pleasure in home, her love for us
                     all, her <br id="n1224" /><span class="line-number">1224. </span>confidence in me, at present such a ble<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ[sic]</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sing <br id="n1225" /><span class="line-number">1225. </span>to me; - she may meet with children
                     who may <br id="n1226" /><span class="line-number">1226. </span>teach her the meaning of things of which at <br id="n1227" /><span class="line-number">1227. </span>present we desire to
                     keep her ignorant, that <br id="n1228" /><span class="line-number">1228. </span>we may give her correct ideas when her mind
                     <br id="n1229" /><span class="line-number">1229. </span>is more advanced; such as Death, falsehood <br id="n1230" /><span class="line-number">1230. </span>&amp;c &amp;c. But our
                     reasons for wishing her to go <br id="n1231" /><span class="line-number">1231. </span>to school, are also strong; not to advance her

                     <br id="n1233" /><span class="line-number">1233. </span>and I agree in not caring for this; but to per=<br id="n1234" /><span class="line-number">1234. </span>=fect her

                     perseverance; and <br id="n1236" /><span class="line-number">1236. </span>to make her apply steadily for a short time. <br id="n1237" /><span class="line-number">1237. </span>She is to
                     go at half past nine, and come <br id="n1238" /><span class="line-number">1238. </span>home at 12; and certainly not in the after=<br id="n1239" /><span class="line-number">1239. </span>-noon at present, if ever. I think enough of <br id="n1240" /><span class="line-number">1240. </span>application may
                     be got in the morning, and <br id="n1241" /><span class="line-number">1241. </span>I shall like her to be with me, with <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span>, <br id="n1242" /><span class="line-number">1242. </span>out of doors &amp;c &amp;c, in the
                     afternoon. I am <br id="n1243" /><span class="line-number">1243. </span>sometimes afraid of becoming a lazy <br id="n1244" /><span class="line-number">1244. </span>mother, willing to
                     send my children <br id="n1245" /><span class="line-number">1245. </span>away from me, and forgetting that on me
                     <br id="n1246" /><span class="line-number">1246. </span>lies the heaviest responsibility. I will try and <br id="n1247" /><span class="line-number">1247. </span>be better in this
                     respect. I intend as much <br id="n1248" /><span class="line-number">1248. </span>as I can, to fetch her from school myself; <br id="n1249" /><span class="line-number">1249. </span>I
                     have several reasons for wishing to do this. 
                     <br id="n1250" /><span class="line-number">1250. </span>One is that she may not be much out of school <span class="figure"><img class="page" id="page-64" src="?????.jpg" alt="photo facsimile page 64" /><span class="caption">Page 64</span></span><br id="n1251" /><span class="line-number">1251. </span>with the other
                     children, though I have reason <br id="n1252" /><span class="line-number">1252. </span>to believe them to be all respectable, and
                     well <br id="n1253" /><span class="line-number">1253. </span>brought up; but as she will be younger, she may <br id="n1254" /><span class="line-number">1254. </span>the more easily
                     catch up any false ideas. <br id="n1255" /><span class="line-number">1255. </span>Then I mean to lead her to tell me in the
                     <br id="n1256" /><span class="line-number">1256. </span>course of her walk home, all the little events <br id="n1257" /><span class="line-number">1257. </span>that have occurred in
                     school. I can perhaps <br id="n1258" /><span class="line-number">1258. </span>set her right if her ideas get confused, and I <br id="n1259" /><span class="line-number">1259. </span>can
                     sympathize with and advise her. <br id="n1260" /><span class="line-number">1260. </span>I have tried to decide in this matter for the
                     <br id="n1261" /><span class="line-number">1261. </span>best, and now we must await the result; only<br id="n1262" /><span class="line-number">1262. </span>pray for <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>God</span>'s ble<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ[sic]</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>sing upon her.</p>
                  
                  <p>Since I last wrote, she and I have begun to <br id="n1263" /><span class="line-number">1263. </span>talk together about religion. I
                     have told <br id="n1264" /><span class="line-number">1264. </span>her the simple truths I thought she could <br id="n1265" /><span class="line-number">1265. </span>understand, such as
                     <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>God</span>'s goodne<span class="choice"><span class="sic">ſ[sic]</span><span class="reg">s</span></span>s and love, <br id="n1266" /><span class="line-number">1266. </span>His watching over us in the silent hours of <br id="n1267" /><span class="line-number">1267. </span>the
                     night &amp;c. I think she has now right ideas <span class="figure"><img class="page" id="page-65" src="?????.jpg" alt="photo facsimile page 65" /><span class="caption">Page 65</span></span><br id="n1268" /><span class="line-number">1268. </span>as far as they go,
                     about this important subject. <br id="n1269" /><span class="line-number">1269. </span>At first she perplexed me very much by her
                     <br id="n1270" /><span class="line-number">1270. </span>very material questions. <q>When does
                         - go to <br id="n1271" /><span class="line-number">1271. </span>bed,</q> &amp;c. But now we talk
                     together in a low <br id="n1272" /><span class="line-number">1272. </span>tone, and she likes to hear about him, and refers <br id="n1273" /><span class="line-number">1273. </span>very
                     properly to him as the <q>Giver of every good <br id="n1274" /><span class="line-number">1274. </span>thing.</q> (Not her

               <p>The ninth entry draws comparisons between the two daughters, and is particularly
                  concerned with health, and again, with the possibility of loss. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> opens the entry by
                  recounting her fright at <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s
                  recent <q>attack of croup,</q> which likely occurred only days after the
                  previous entry. This illness was deeply significant for <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>; it forms the primary
                  substance of a contemporaneous letter, dated March 30,
                  1838 to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Eliza (Aunt Lizzy)
                     Gaskell</span>, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>William Gaskell</span>’s
                  then unmarried sister, and one of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s most frequent early correspondents. Gaskell also comments
                  in both sources (diary and letter) about the death of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Eddy Deane</span>, whose father, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Dr. Richard Deane</span>, was <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s uncle <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Peter Holland</span>’s partner in <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Knutsford</span>. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Eddy
                     Deane</span> was nine months older than <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> and had been ill with croup the same night as <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> and died four days later.
                  G<span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> interjects a
                  prayer for resignation into the account following this story. </p>
               <p>This entry marks another instance of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s own rereading of her journal. As she turns from recording
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s illness to fulfill
                  her promise of devoting the next <q>chapter</q> to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span>, she writes <q>I have been amused on
                     looking at my former writing in this book to perceive the difference between
                     the two little girls.</q>
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> has done this
                  before, commenting on her own perception of the diary as she rereads it before
                  continuing its composition.</p>
               <p><span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> continues with a
                  description of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s
                  development, much like those earlier in the diary for <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span> is independent, crawling and pulling herself up, playing and
                  making noise. She is more fretful than <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>, and <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> reasserts her former <q>rules,</q> although in
                  Meta’s case, she fears that the servants are spoiling her rather than attending to
                  them. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span> eagerly wants what her sister
                  has, and according to the entry, eats nearly everything she is given as well. The
                  entry ends with a brief comment on the sisters’ relationship, this time worrying
                  that although they get along well, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> on occasion hurts <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span> knowingly. The entry closes with another prayer for their
                  preservation, and a dash, perhaps indicating a hurried closing. </p>

            <div class="headnote-text">
               <p>This is the shortest entry in the diary, barely covering two handwritten pages. In
                  the entry which follows, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> states that she had been interrupted when she last wrote,
                  which in part explains the brevity of this entry. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>’s focus here is on
                  comparing her daughters; <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span> once again
                  is described as <q>much the most energetic</q> and constantly
                  <q>busy</q>, whereas <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> worries that <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> is not <q>industrious</q> and requires guidance to
                  keep busy. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> has improved
                  however, and <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> is
                  pleased to see that her former <q>obstinacy</q> is growing less frequent.
                  Even as she comments on her daughters’ achievements and cautiously observes their
                  faults, however, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span>
                  takes on herself the responsibility: <q>I am afraid I do not set her a good
                     example,</q> she writes of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s lack of initiative. In spite of this however, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> has begun to read and sew, though
                  she is only four years old. The entry ends rather abruptly after <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> asserts that she still
                  ascribes much of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s
                  behavior to physical complaints; she makes a consistent effort to keep her
                  <q>quiet, as otherwise she suffers much from exhaustion which shows itself
                     in increased irritability.</q> Here the entry ends.</p>
               <p>In the interim between this entry and the previous one, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Queen Victoria</span>’s coronation took place,
                  although there is no indication that the Gaskells were at all involved in the

                     sometimes in mischief to be sure, <br id="n1408" /><span class="line-number">1408. </span>but she is much the most energetic of the

               <p>The final entry in the diary is still quite brief, although at the outset
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> states that she
                  intends to <q>make up for</q> having been interrupted in the previous
                  entry. She continues to worry about <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s health, and writes that they are traveling to <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Prospect Hill</span>, the home of a relative of
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>William</span>’s, south of <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Warrington</span>, on the recommendation of William’s
                  brother, <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Sam Gaskell</span>, who was a physician
                  and seems to have been a frequent purveyor of medical advice to the family.
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> is progressing in other
                  respects, as well, and has begun to have regular lessons at home in reading and
                  sewing. <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> prays for
                  patience in regulating her temper during these lessons. While she applauds
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span>’s sympathy for others,
                  she is still concerned about what she believes is a lack of perseverance.
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Meta</span>, however, is generous, walked at
                  18 months, and is very energetic, even passionate at times. Just before closing,
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Gaskell</span> mentions that
                  <span class="pIndex"><span class="pi-note"></span>Marianne</span> has begun to eat
                  <q>animal food</q> now that she is four years old. The entry closes, as
                  most do, with a prayer, <q>May God bless both my dear children.</q>

                     <br id="n1445" /><span class="line-number">1445. </span>sometimes reads nearly a line. She seems to like <br id="n1446" /><span class="line-number">1446. </span>it and takes pains.
