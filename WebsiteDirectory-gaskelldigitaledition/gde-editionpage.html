                     to writing about her own maternal choices - in this case, particularly her plans
                     for handling common parenting concerns, including bedtimes, how to respond to
                     cries and demands, and developmental milestones like learning to walk. This keen
                     awareness of motherhood is marked by self-doubt and an equally pronounced sense of
                     self-judgment stemming from Victorian assumptions about maternal duty. <span class="pIndex">Gaskell</span><span class="pi-note">Elizabeth Gaskell, the author of the journal, was born in 1810 and died in 1865. She

                     her fears of maternal mortality, which echo as an underlying theme throughout the
                     diary, both in her repeated fears of loss and in her inclusion of prayers for her
                     daughters’ safety. The brief <q>God bless her</q> that closes this entry
                     marks a tendency to conclude her entries with prayers for her daughters’ health
                     and safety that continues throughout the diary. At all times, the relationship
                     between mother and daughters is colored by a pervasive fear of death. </span></p>

               <p><span class="prose">This is the only entry in the diary to have a significant portion of the text

                     the edge of the remaining page is smooth. The second page [recto] shows marks
                     where a small 2-3 fragment of the page is still attached to the binding of the
                     codex. Given the typical spacing of <span class="pIndex">Gaskell</span><span class="pi-note">Elizabeth Gaskell, the author of the journal, was born in 1810 and died in 1865. She

                     across the lines with equal signs, and the number and placement of the extant
                     marks on the fragment, we can assume that approximately six lines of text are
                     missing on the recto side of the page, and 5-6 lines on the verso. We can surmise
                     that the all of the text on the surrounding pages, together with the section that
                     remains from the lower section of the page, are all fragments of the second diary
                     entry, and that the lost sections did not include the start or endpoint of another
                     diary entry. This is clear because the following (third) entry, dated October fourth 1835, begins, <q>I see it is
                        exactly two months since I last wrote in this book,</q> which indicates
                     that this second entry, dated August 4th, is the

                     maternal instincts. She is deeply self-critical and sets high standards for

                     written sooner, although it has been only two months since the previous entry. She
                     also claims that she <q>ought not</q> to be negligent in any regard toward
                     her daughter, including in this instance, in writing about her in the journal. Of

                     merely record keeping or reflection; it is a deeply personal, emotionally invested

                              Luke 2 contains the most widely referenced Nativity account. Although Christmas is
                              in December, the reading may have appeared in February in conjunction with Candlemas,
                              which occurs on February 2nd. Candlemas is a Feast of the Purification of Mary and
                              also the Presentation of Jesus in the temple (40 days following the birth of a son,
                              the child was brought to the temple and a sacrifice made for purification of the mother).
                              Interestingly, nearly all translations of this text refer to Mary by name, but Gaskell
                              chooses here the term “mother” instead, emphasizing the relationship. She is relating
