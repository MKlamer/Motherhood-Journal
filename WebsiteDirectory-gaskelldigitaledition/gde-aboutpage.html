                The Gaskell Journal Digital Edition
            </h3>
            <p>About the Digital Edition: 
                
                My digital dissertation project, <q>&#39;The Music of [Our] Thoughts&#39;: Elizabeth Gaskell&#39;s Motherhood Journal, A Digital Edition</q> is the first digital dissertation in MSU&#39;s English Department, and offers readers and scholars alike digital access to Gaskell&#39;s manuscript for the first time. Poised at the intersection of Victorian studies, digital humanities, textual scholarship and motherhood studies, this digital edition will offer a richly contextualized transcript, fully hand-encoded in TEI-XML according to the latest P5 guidelines, presented in conjunction with annotations, high-quality IIIF images of the manuscript pages, and critical essays. </p><p>Gaskell has traditionally been recognized for the clarity of social vision presented in her novels, yet the journal shows her constant indecision and self-doubt in her role as a mother. Historically treated as an <q>apprenticeship</q> text that reveals Gaskell&#39;s talent at characterization, this edition aims to reevaluate the journal not as a precursor to the novels, but as a vibrant, rich text in which Gaskell grappled with a broader social vision of what it meant to be a Victorian wife and mother. The resulting Edition, which grows out of MSU&#39;s vibrant community of cutting-edge DH researchers and spaces, ultimately invites us to reimagine and reframe the fluctuations of the mutual identity formations at work in the mother-daughter relationship inscribed in the text, reimagining the nineteenth century maternal journal as a collaborative genre of self-narrative.
