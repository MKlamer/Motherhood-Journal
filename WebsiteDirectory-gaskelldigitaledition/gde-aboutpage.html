            <h3>The Journal:</h3>
            <p> The copy-text for this journal transcription is the <a href="https://explore.library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/33745">original manuscript</a>, currently held in the Special Collections of the Brotherton Library, Leeds UK. Elizabeth Gaskell&#39;s journal is contained in a notebook, approximately 4 1/2 by 7 inches, bound with marbled boards. The spine and corners are in calf. The edges of the leaves are also marbled. The paper within the notebook has been gathered throughout in twelves, although the first gathering has only six leaves. As first noted by Anita Wilson and J.A.V. Chapple in their 1996 edition, <i>Private Voices</i>, some gatherings contain the watermark &#39;Harris 1822&#39;. The diary comprises the first approximately 80 pages of the notebook. The remaining pages are blank. The text is written throughout in black ink. The binding of the codex, although loose in several places, is still in tact. Apart from the third page in the second entry, from which the top third has been cut away, the manuscript is complete. Gaskell's prose is quite clear and legible throughout. The ink in some sections has begun fading with age. The fading has made certain portions of the text difficult to read, and has particularly affected Gaskell&#39;s outstrokes, punctuation, and the dots on the characters <q>i</q> and <q>j</q>.</p>
                <p>The manuscript has been in the possession of Gaskell&#39;s descendants since her death. At her death, the journal became the property of Marianne Gaskell (later Holland), the daughter about whom much of the journal is written, and to whom it is dedicated. Marianne Holland and her husband Thurstan Holland had seven children. The manuscript was first passed on to Marianne&#39;s oldest son, William Edward Thurstan Holland, born in 1867. Marianne&#39;s younger son, Brian Holland, and her daughter, Florence Holland, authorized the publication of the 1923 edition of the journal by Clement Shorter. After William Edward Thurstan Holland, the manuscript was passed to his only daughter, Margaret Evelyn Averia, who married Clifford Trevor Jones. Margaret&#39;s only daughter, Elizabeth Rosemary, received the manuscript after this, and authorized the 1996 print edition, produced by Anita Wilson and J.A.V. Chapple, as well as the 2006 edition (part of the Pickering Master&#39;s Edition of Gaskell&#39;s works) by Joanne Shattock. After the death of Mrs. Rosemary Trevor Dabbs, the journal became the possession of Mrs. Sarah Prince, by whose gracious permission this new digital Edition has been authorized.</p>
                
              <h3>Continuity with Previous Editions: </h3>
               <p>The transcription was hand-encoded from photographic images of the manuscript obtained through the gracious generosity of Kristen Mapes. Gaskell&#39;s chirography is remarkably clear and quite consistent, however in the event of unclear characters, consultation was supplemented by comparison with the high-quality IIIF images made available through the Brotherton Special Collections site, and additionally through in-person scrutiny of the manuscript during a research trip to the UK made in the summer of 2018. Where doubt remained, I have adhered to a policy of submitting to the wisdom of previous editors, and have found no reason in such cases to substantially change the transcription offered in these editions. In nearly every case, this new edition adheres to the faithful transcriptions made in 1996 by Anita Wilson and J.A.V. Chapple and in 2006 by Joanne Shattock. The rare occasions in which this transcription differs from previous editors have been notated in the <q>Editorial Policy</q>.</p>
          <p>Previous editions of the diary have generally also adopted a policy of retaining the character of the manuscript, although they have each adopted some processes of regularization.</p> 
              <h3>1923: <i>My Diary: The Early Years of My Daughter, Marianne</i>, Edited by Clement Shorter </h3>
              <p>The first printed edition of the diary, published in a limited 50-copy run in 1923 by Clement Shorter, regularized much of Gaskell’s punctuation and spellings throughout. Shorter&#39;s changes are made silently; although the edition offers no statement of editorial policy, Shorter seems to have set a purpose of providing a clean, reading copy which adhered to regularized spelling and punctuation. Shorter removes commas he believes are unnecessary, for example deleting Gaskell&#39;s comma from the phrase <q>I had no idea children at her age, made such continued noises</q> (Shorter 7). Shorter also adopts regularized spellings, for example <q>ankles</q> for <q>ancles,</q> and makes corrections to her grammar, changing it&#39;s to its in the dedication page (Shorter 1; 7). He also adds commas where he deems necessary, as well as regularizing the datelines at the heads of each entry. Gaskell’s underlining he italicizes instead.</p> 
                <h3>1996: <i>Private Voices: The Diaries of Elizabeth Gaskell and Sophia Holland</i>, Edited by J.A.V. Chapple and Anita Wilson</h3>
                  <p>The 1996 edition, edited by Anita Wilson and J.A.V. Chapple, similarly adheres to a conservative policy of editing, <q>making only very minor changes. Superscript letters have been lowered, some full stops or dashes silently added and single quotation marks used instead of double</q> (8). Chapple and Wilson similarly change Gaskell&#39;s underlining to italics, and have also regularized Gaskell&#39;s abbreviation of Marianne&#39;s name to MA. Alterations within the manuscript are identified with endnotes.</p> 
                  <h3>2006: <i>The Diary</i>, <i>The Works of Elizabeth Gaskell, Part I, Vol. 1</i>, Edited by Joanne Shattock</h3>
                  <p>Joanne Shattock&#39;s 2006 edition, published as part of the Pickering Master&#39;s Edition of Gaskell&#39;s Works, adheres the most closely to Gaskell&#39;s original text, retaining Gaskell&#39;s superscripts, punctuation, and spellings. Shattock regularized Gaskell&#39;s abbreviation for Marianne to M.A., and has also changed underlining to italics. Shattock uses brackets to mark alterations within the manuscript.</p>
                 <h3>2020: The Digital Edition</h3>
                      <p> In two regards this new transcription does differ markedly from the previous editions: in the choice to retain Gaskell&#39;s own terminology of <q>journal</q>, and in my decision to preserve Gaskell&#39;s use of underlining throughout the manuscript, in contrast to the previous editors&#39; policy of rendering all underlined text in italics. This aim to reproduce the manuscript completely, as far as possible, complete with its own idiosyncracies, has been the central driving principle of this edition. The digital medium makes possible heretofore impossible levels of comparison between the manuscript pages and transcriptions of the journal. XML encoding has also enabled the edition to toggle between the manuscript text and normalized spellings or punctuation within the text, allowing the reader to explore the minutiae of the manuscript. The choice to maintain Gaskell&#39;s underlining is twofold: first, retaining the underlining preserves the character and authenticity of Gaskell&#39;s original manuscript; second, the presence of the underlined text provides greater clarity for reader comparison between the transcription and the manuscript images which are offered for the first time in this digital edition.</p>
            <p>The decision to return to Gaskel&#39;s own use of the term <q>journal</q>, which has been made in contradistinction to all previous published editions of the text, is intended first and foremost to adhere as much as possible to Gaskell&#39;s own textual choices. Gaskell never titled her manuscript, and she refers to it within the text as a <q>journal,</q> or as a <q>book</q>. The choice between the terms <q>diary</q> and <q>journal</q> is a fraught one at best; scholars and practitioners disagree about the distinction in terms. In <i>A Brief History of Diaries from Pepys to Blogs</i>, Alexandra Johnson writes: 
               <q>Both words come from the Latin root for &#39;day&#39;. But ever since Samuel Johnson defined diary in his Dictionary as &#39;an account of the transactions, accidents and observation of every day; a journal&#39;, they&#39;ve been used interchangeably. For purists, a diary is a daily factual record, dated and chronological. A journal is kept more fitfully and for deeper reflection. One records, the other reflects.</q> (Johnson 13). In many cases, diary is understood to be written with regularity, while journals take on a broader definition. The diary, traditionally, is a daily activity, heavily marked by chronology. The journal, however, tends to be viewed as a flexible form, which rewards variations of thought and purpose.</p> 
              <p> In this regard, Gaskell&#39;s choice of <q>journal</q> seems the most apt, and in keeping with the editorial policy of maintaining the integrity of the document, this edition has elected to maintain her own terminology as well. Gaskell&#39;s journal is written in starts and pauses over a number of years. Taken together, the entries average out to about one every four months, which hardly qualifies as a daily account. The journal is also quite capacious in content: encompassing Marianne&#39;s physical and emotional development, Gaskell&#39;s  own fears and choices as a mother, as well as family events as they occurred. The journals are lengthy and reflective, rather than cursory and factual. The choice of <q>journal</q> for this new Digital Edition is meant to emphasize the <q>fitful</q> and &#39;reflective&#39; nature of the text, and to invite new conversations surrounding Gaskell&#39;s life writing.
