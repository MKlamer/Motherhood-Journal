                      <p>In the penultimate sentence of her journal&#39;s opening entry, Elizabeth Gaskell evokes a powerful metanarrative description of her journal&#39;s creation that foregrounds the mother-child bond that was its catalyst. Gaskell recounts writing her journal while listening to her sleeping daughter, Marianne, &#34;whose regular breathing has been the music of my thoughts all the time I have been writing&#34; (Journal, March 4, 1835). In this moment, Gaskell the writer and Gaskell the mother are inextricably intertwined, and both take their impetus from the sleeping Marianne, in whose presence the text is written, and without whom it would not exist. Marianne and her mother are bound together in this moment, and Gaskell draws out this connection with her musical metaphor, wherein her own musings and her daughter&#39;s restful breathing combine to create a peaceful harmony. It is this image of the maternal relationship as music that sets the tone for the entire journal as a text that records, reflects on, and mourns motherhood, while taking on a mothering role itself.</p> 
                <br/><h4 id="Mother" class="offset">Gaskell as Mother and Writer</h4>
                      <p>The oft-cited fact that Gaskell&#39;s maternal loss propelled her into a writing career creates the temptation to neatly&#8212;but falsely&#8212;separate Gaskell&#39;s life into distinct periods of motherhood and writing. In the preface to Gaskell&#39;s first novel, Mary Barton, Gaskell herself famously wrote: &#34;Three years ago I became anxious (from circumstances that need not be more fully alluded to) to employ myself in writing a work of fiction.&#34;<a href="#footnote1">[1]</a> The circumstance Gaskell alluded to was the loss of her nine-month-old son, who had succumbed to scarlet fever while on a family trip. The link Gaskell forges in this preface between her maternal loss and her authorship has been perpetuated by biographers for over a century, leading to an assumed separation between her roles as mother and author. Angus Easson, for example, wrote in 1979: &#34;Whatever part the children played in [Gaskell&#39;s] writing&#8230; only one seems responsible for starting her writing, and that, tragically, her only son, William [&#8230;] who died in August 1845, within a year of birth.&#34;<a href="#footnote2">[2]</a> Eason&#39;s emphasis on this causative relationship between Willie&#39;s death and Gaskell&#39;s authorship continues in contemporary scholarship. More recently, the brief biography of Gaskell provided by the British Library&#39;s online resource, <a href="https://www.bl.uk/people/elizabeth-gaskell" target="_blank">Discovering Literature</a>, makes a similar claim: &#34;Shattered by the death of her infant son in 1845, [Gaskell] turned to writing for solace.&#34; Admittedly, these critics are correct in observing that Gaskell&#39;s novels postdated the births of her children. In their use of absolute terminology however, like &#34;started her writing&#34; and &#34;turned to writing&#34;, they suggest a marked change or shift toward a writing career that misrepresents Gaskell&#39;s long standing commitment to writing during the early years of her motherhood. Her authorship, according to these assessments, appears to have begun suddenly, as an escape from the trials that come with motherhood. Gaskell, however, had been writing for many years; Willie&#39;s death, far from inciting a new career trajectory, merely shifted the balance of her responsibilities more strongly toward intentional, professional writing.</p>
                      <p>Gaskell wrote even in the early years of her motherhood, both for public audiences and in her journal, as a way to consciously shape her own maternal practice. By the time of Mary Barton&#39;s publication, Gaskell had been writing poignantly about her motherhood&#8212;in poems, letters, and in her journal&#8212;for nearly fifteen years, beginning in 1834. She had also been writing for publication since 1836, and possibly sooner, though no evidence has survived. Writing, far from being an escape, was a core activity of Gaskell&#39;s life, and of her motherhood, although the two pursuits frequently interrupted each other. Gaskell wrote in 1862 to an aspiring author whose name has not been identified about the challenge of balancing writing and motherhood: &#34;When I had little children I do not think I could have written stories, because I should have become too much absorbed in my fictitious people to attend to my real ones.&#34;<a href="#footnote3">[3]</a> Within this letter, Gaskell suggests that mothering took priority over her writing in the years before Mary Barton. The level of care she put into her fictional &#34;people&#34; led her to consciously prioritize her own children. Yet she did write&#8212;in spite of her assertions in this letter&#8212;even while her children were &#39;little&#39;. </p>
                      <p>The roles of mother and writer were, for Gaskell and for many other women, never mutually exclusive, and instead, were intrinsically connected and mutually productive forces. Gaskell&#39;s first publication, a poem entitled <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/image?id=uc1.31210019908464;seq=66;size=200;rotation=0" target="_blank">&#34;Sketches Among The Poor&#34;</a>, was co-authored with husband William and appeared in print in January 1837, in Volume 41 of <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000496211" target="_blank">Blackwood&#39;s Edinburgh Magazine</a> (48-50). The publication of this poem suggests that as early as 1836, when fifteen-month-old Marianne was their only daughter, the Gaskells were already engaged in writing professionally. <!-- Anchor targets the individual above to account for fixed header--><a href="gde-personpage.html#Anne_Gaskell">Margaret</a> (called &#34;Meta&#34;), the Gaskells&#39; second daughter, was born in February 1837, a month after &#34;Sketches&#34; was published. Around the same time, the journal began to bear signs of Gaskell&#39;s professional writing aspirations; Gaskell refers to one late entry in 1838 as a &#34;chapter&#34;. The following year, in 1839, William Gaskell published <span class="title">Temperance Rhymes</span> anonymously; Elizabeth Gaskell recounts in an 1841 letter to an American Unitarian minister, John Pierpont, that the volume had been praised by Mary Howitt and Wordsworth.<a href="#footnote4">[4]</a> Gaskell was silent on the subject of her own success in the same letter, although she too, had been published again. By late 1839, when the Gaskells&#39; daughters were five and two, William Howitt had published an excerpt of one of Elizabeth Gaskell&#39;s letters in his <a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/3044838.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAnUwggJxBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJiMIICXgIBADCCAlcGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM9TZt0JZjaT7I4u7BAgEQgIICKNBpOnvuEbKiIBs9Fc42ZRCMP1IjVylBEX803vzCAL8ev1pjQG6NlFHMNnb-4vxsfDObmnIKpd9RY6w0CnaLOE-zV6NM-2w36mmkYTkVhpKqJLzwmgrROJGQQKGsHK87HgV9aFORpGfYFQ4-iZ1Rl9zKacvcnfF8dzCu6QJk8QZpqUh8OODbXaqJ5Bs6n-a0jL8SDATuoTUV7D_PKNXtbS_rwMiprEoZo_OZPmDhSCfrAwXAQ_Pubid9EsF18tZu9ZNTi-9LHkv48gmZiojJaVi4oOag06KNbrviYGDG1dpksblMLy0iSI1TT-iEEnl6stbZzoqctOQNHgBL9o2pHtEmsYSVwfYUzK6ZCxtzdIioeSDMiJMnIYhNA3uIO0dy_QdOnjuMRPsIYmA6CRIl5WqJ8VD4G4JHjNn3tHiRBgJsj_9BaZ83jBSVQ2vY4XPl2fkEYAKuvYPwgFaHYrosu4PncdUYfOvYpnHszzjDoqKjdrCsktfWahAmrM-JZikE-vnjymaD7RgNwlk60Ezb1uHgb9pP5mMaD7597Z4ojaBPPQvbQ0zzFSeLUWAEHJttCXbEux2cjk4hIPoT9UMcwmNIrzzznMUhfGbvS2Hu1UMbCn9ddGf5k4Zjt9DJ_pQNJT54dClpdLXLX16FXiL5o2XYfcrMAxQ5Rmiu47vRS9-w6eShjwYRX-p8PnJ6_h41uyyfvD1BYOOCkP93tsWNZPMj-UNHUHXdEw" target="_blank">Visits to Remarkable Places</a>, and a second excerpt appeared in another work in 1840. These published excerpts were drawn from letters written in 1838, at the same time she was keeping the journal about young Marianne and Meta. Mary Barton was begun after Willie&#39;s death in 1845, when the Gaskells&#39; third daughter, Florence, was only three. At the time of its publication in 1848, Marianne, Meta, and Florence were aged 14, 11, and 6, and Gaskell had yet another toddler at home: her youngest daughter, Julia, who had been born in 1846. Although she claims that fiction would have taken her attention away from her daughters, Gaskell&#39;s publication history shows that writing was never far from her mind, even during the earliest years of her motherhood.</p><br/><h4 id="Characterization" class="offset">Gaskell's Characterization</h4>
                      <p>Scholars frequently comment on the detail Gaskell brings to her depictions of others, a descriptive subtlety that also marks her journal. As Anita Wilson claims in her introduction to the 1996 version of the journal: &#34;without sentimentality or condescension, Gaskell chronicled the pleasures and dilemmas of daily life with a keen sense of observation, sympathy, curiosity, and humour – the qualities which would later characterize her fiction.&#34;<a href="#footnote5">[5]</a> While claiming that &#34;[the diary] has not received the scholarly consideration it deserves,&#34; Wilson suggests the journal is amateurish: &#34;a foreshadowing of her development as a novelist&#34; (11). Wilson similarly claims that Gaskell&#39;s &#34;emerging roles as new mother and apprentice writer are mutually illuminating as she recounts her experiences with the challenges, dilemmas, and rewards of Victorian parenthood.&#34; This identification of Gaskell&#39;s journal as the work of an &#39;apprentice writer&#39; effectively subordinates Gaskell&#39;s unpublished works to her better-known novels.  Yet Gaskell&#39;s depictions of &#39;the pleasures and dilemmas of daily life&#39; begin in the journal not as inferior sketches, but as fully realized observations that mirror the careful, thoughtful writing that would enliven her novels, and which William Howitt had already recognized in her 1838 letters&#39; descriptions of Clopton Hall and the local custom of &#34;sanding&#34; the doorstops of homes with poetry verses on the morning of a friend&#39;s wedding (Letters 292). Wilson&#39;s categorization of Gaskell&#39;s early writing as developmental is surprising, given her call for greater attention to the journal. Gaskell&#39;s &#39;powers of observation&#39; are not limited to the novels, but in fact are present in all her extant writing. The journal displays not only a keen &#39;receptivity to detail&#39;, but a tendency to meticulously analyze the choices inherent in daily life for their eventual outcomes. Within the pages of her journal, Gaskell carefully weighs and considers both Victorian ideals and her own decisions in light of them, paying careful attention to how her plans affect her own and her daughter&#39;s future. </p>
                      <p>Previous editors of Gaskell&#39;s journal have read the manuscript as a rehearsal of the rich characterizations and keen observation that mark Gaskell&#39;s fiction, rather than as a text which demonstrates that her introspective description and detailed, nuanced storytelling were well established even in her early years. Most Gaskell scholarship has focused on the last 15-20 years of her life, the years in which she was writing novels and journalism prolifically. Scholars like Easson have described Gaskell&#39;s writing as possessing a &#34;subtle delicacy&#34; Even scholars who take into consideration the variety of her output still ground their analysis in their perception of her attention to minute detail, as in this assessment by Shelston: &#34;was she best considered as the delicate provincial ironist of Cranford or the sympathetic if soft-hearted chronicler of urban realities&#34; as in Mary Barton<a href="#footnote6">[6]</a>. These descriptions of Gaskell&#39;s artistic skills suggest the work of a miniaturist in their emphasis on detail and delicacy. While the journal manifestly demonstrates the same attention to detail and careful sensitivity to the subtleties of individual emotion that mark the novels, it does not follow that her writing about motherhood must be taken as a precursor or preparation for novel writing. Rather, I seek here to foreground the ways in which, on the contrary, Gaskell&#39;s writing had always been carried out during motherhood, and often born of it.</p>
                      <p>The majority of Gaskell&#39;s extant work before Mary Barton consists of life writing which demonstrates Gaskell&#39;s intense interiority, and the journal in particular manifests the role that writing played in Gaskell&#39;s decision making and self-regulation. Though twenty-one letters survive which predate 1838, when the journal was abandoned, the journal is her earliest sustained piece of writing. While already engaged in writing for the public, Gaskell also actively wrote in her journal as a means of mothering. Gaskell wrote out of grief, not only the novel Mary Barton, but also as early as 1836, in a poem recalling her first daughter, stillborn in 1833. She wrote out of confusion, using the journal pages to evaluate and determine the best maternal practices for raising her daughters. She wrote through anguish and fear over Marianne&#39;s frequent illnesses. Above all, she wrote to preserve her maternal relationship beyond the deaths which she feared and expected. Writing, for Gaskell, was a means of shaping her own identity as a mother, and a means of mothering not only her daughters, but herself, preparing her to provide her daughters with the constant &#39;tender sympathy&#39; that she recommended to her authorially ambitious unnamed correspondent.</p>
                      <br/><h4 id="Journal-Mothers">The Journal That Mothers</h4>
                      <p>Gaskell&#39;s journal brings motherhood forward, drawing attention to the fact that the author does not leave her motherhood behind to write, but rather sacrifices her time for creative pursuits to serve her daughters, even using her writing as a means to shape her mothering. The early descriptive moment in which Gaskell describes herself writing the journal at Marianne&#39;s bedside at a first glance seems to relegate Gaskell&#39;s maternity to a background position: Marianne is there while she writes, breathing quietly as a backdrop to the scratches of the pen. Yet, instead of requiring a &#34;room of [her] own&#34;, Gaskell penned her text at Marianne&#39;s bedside, still consciously acting in her mother-role even while she engages in creative expression. Gaskell&#39;s journaling occurs in quiet moments within the broader concerns of motherhood; the vast majority of entries that give a time of writing mention &#34;Evening&#34;. One might expect that writing here is fragile&#8212;accomplished in stolen moments and capable of being shattered in an instant by the mother&#39;s response to her child&#39;s cry. Gaskell herself wrote about prioritizing her children in the journal: &#34;I think it is the duty of every mother to sacrifice a good deal rather than  have her child unnecessarily irritated by anything&#34; (Journal March 10 1835). Her insistence on maternal sacrifice, taken together with her advice to her unknown correspondent, emphasizes that although Gaskell was writing before 1838, the choice to prioritize her motherhood was a deliberate one.</p>
                      <p>Gaskell viewed motherhood as imparting an intense responsibility and used the journal to hold herself to a high standard. Contemporaneous American author Lydia Maria Child wrote in her 1831 <a href="https://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/child/book/book.html" target="_blank">Mother&#39;s Book</a> wrote that &#34;The first and most important thing... is, that the mother should keep her own spirit in tranquility and purity; for it is beyond all doubt that the state of a mother affects her child&#34;. Gaskell journal demonstrates that she felt compelled to strive for this level of self-regulation; she expresses this ideal prayerfully at the conclusion of the third entry: &#34;Oh Lord strengthen my good purposes &amp; preserve a due sense of my holy trust&#34; (Journal October 4, 1835). Gaskell&#39;s invocation of motherhood as &#34;holy&#34; betrays the depth of importance she placed on her own maternal practice, viewing it as an inherently moral responsibility with far-reaching consequences for her daughters. Later in the century, Victorian mothers would be held to the ultimate standard of holiness: that of an <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4099/4099-h/4099-h.htm" target="_blank">&#34;angel in the house&#34;</a>, a term deriving from Coventry Patmore&#39;s famed poem (1854). Gaskell&#39;s journal depicts her efforts as the &#34;strong sense of responsibility which I now feel&#34; to attain such a standard while engaging in the practical day-to-day tasks of raising children and running a household. According to Elizabeth Langland, Victorian ideology prescribed careful management to women not only of children, but also of the home, and ultimately, of the family&#39;s social status: &#34;The domestic sanctuary overseen by its attending angel can be decoded as a theater for the staging of a family&#39;s social position, a staging that depends on prescribed practices.&#34;<a href="#footnote7">[7]</a> Victorian mothers, particularly of the middle class, had many models to turn to for such practices. </p>
