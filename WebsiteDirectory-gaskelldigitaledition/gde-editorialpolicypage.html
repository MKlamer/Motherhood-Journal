        <div class="content"><h3>Editorial Policy:</h3>
        <h5>Accidentals:</h5>
            <p>The editing policy has been to preserve Gaskell&#39;s own spelling and punctuation as it exists in the manuscript. I have retained Gaskell&#39;s use of underlining throughout the manuscript, encoding such instances with a &lt;hi&gt; element. On occasion, where it appeared to improve the clarity of the text for the reader, standard spellings or punctuation have been supplied as part of the encoding, with markup indicating the extant state of the manuscript as well as the standard variant. Examples of this include editorially supplying a handful of missing closing parentheses, terminal punctuation and/or quotation marks throughout the text, and noting correct spellings of certain words alongside Gaskell’s idiosyncratic spellings, such as <q>ancles</q> for <q>ankles</q>.</p>
            <h5>Normalization: &lt;choice&gt; Elements</h5>
            <p>I have continued the policy of using encoded &lt;choice&gt; elements to markup any instances where Gaskell’s word choice differs from contemporary usage. One instance of this is Gaskell’s tendency to split words which are commonly compounds: in particular <q>any thing</q>, <q>every thing</q> and <q>any one</q>. Rather than normalizing such forms, I have elected to maintain Gaskells&#39; own usage, wrapping a &lt;choice&gt; element around the <q>split</q> word. The &lt;choice&gt; element is also used to highlight Gaskell&#39;s occasional use of the long s character for double medial s patterns throughout the journal.  In order to render this visible to the reader, Gaskell&#39;s long s (&#383;) characters have been encoded using the unicode character <q>#383&</q> only when they appear in Gaskell&#39;s hand. The long s, where it appears, is also wrapped in a &lt;choice&gt; element using &lt;sic&gt; to indicate the long s as written and &lt;reg&gt; to indicate the regularized spelling. This encoding format allows the transformations to draw on the XML transcription to produce reading texts that either reflect or regularize Gaskell&#39;s original spelling depending upon the audience for each reproduced text.
               <p>A final trait of Gaskell&#39;s writing is her tendency to write words which break across the line. In nearly every case, she inserts an equal sign on both sides of the break, as in the following example:  
                <br/><q>affect= 
                <br/>=ions</q>. 
                   <br/>All new lines have been denoted in the markup with the use of a line beginning element: &lt;lb/&gt;, which is a self-closing tag and thus easily marks as a milestone each new line of the manuscript text. As the &lt;lb/&gt; tag is generally understood to represent a new word in addition to a new line, these line beginning elements have been encoded with the additional @break attribute, with a value of <q>no,</q> to indicate that the line beginning does not identify a new word, but is rather a continuation of the previous word. The equal signs stand outside of this markup, and thus appear, as they do in Gaskell&#39;s manuscript, as part of the text. There is one exception to this policy; in the second journal entry, someone has cut away the top third of one page. On the recto side, one partial split word, denoted by the equal sign followed by a partial character, appears. As this symbol appears without context, it has not been encoded, but its presence is mentioned as part of the editorial note identifying the gap in the manuscript.</p>
        <p>The cut-away page in entry two is the most significant alteration in the manuscript; on the whole, Gaskell&#39;s text is very cleanly written, with only a dozen or so instances of alteration or obscured text throughout. The cutaway is marked with a &lt;gap&gt; element. The obscure text has been marked with an &lt;unclear&gt; element. One unusual feature of the diary is Gaskell&#39;s frequent use of lengthy spaces within the text. These spaces appear roughly equivalent in size to the space Gaskell gives to a new paragraph indentation, except that they occur mid-line within the text, and inconsistently function as either a terminal gap, which appears to begin a new paragraph, or simply a long break between sentences that are closely connected. In an attempt to avoid imposing editorially inflected order upon the text, I have elected to encode these as &lt;space&gt; elements, with a @type attribute that designates, to the best of my knowledge, whether these gaps are functioning as terminal stops or merely sentence-level  pauses.</p> 
                   <p> In one case I have emended the text from the transcription provided by Wilson and Chapple in their 1996 edition. Shortly before the cut-away leaf in the second entry (August 4, 1835), a word occurs which is struckthrough. Wilson and Chapple note this word as <q>we,</q> changed from <q>I</q>. On close inspection of the manuscript, however, it is apparent that the strikethrough, which Gaskell usually writes as a horizontally squiggled line, is passing through <q>we</q> rather than <q>I</q>. In this case, I concur with Joanne Shattock that Gaskell changed <q>we</q> to <q>I</q>, writing: <q>If I could but consider a child properly, what a beautiful safe-guard from evil would it&#39;s [sic] presence be</q> (Diary, August 4, 1835). This change is consistent with Gaskell&#39;s writing throughout the diary; she critiques herself frequently, and comments on the responsibility which weighs heavily on her as a mother. Changing the pronoun to <q>we</q> would have been an uncharacteristically public gesture, given the context in which it occurs.<p>
                    
<h4>Coding Principles:</h4>
<h5>Structural Markup:</h5>
        <p>The journal has been encoded as a single XML-TEI file. Journal entries, together with their respective headnotes, are enclosed within &lt;div type=<q>journal</q>> tags. These are numbered and have been assigned unique ids for linking online. Each individual headnote and entry is further delineated using &lt;div> elements using type=<q>headnote | entry</q> attributes. The initial dedication page is encoded using the same structure with a <q>dedication</q> value on the <q>type</q> attribute. Each &lt;div&gt; has been provided with a n (number) attribute for easier identification. Within each headnote, the text is preceded by a set of encoded &lt;head&gt; tags which reiterate the date of the entry, the ages of Gaskell&#39;s daughters at the time of writing, the time elapsed since the previous entry, and the approximate length of the entry, counted in manuscript pages.</p> 
        <p>Within the &lt;body&gt; of the file, the XML encoding includes &lt;p&gt; tags to denote each paragraph, notes each new line with a &lt;lb/&gt; tag, and encodes page breaks with &lt;pb/&gt;. This structural markup allows the site to render the transcribed lines directly alongside the manuscript lines as they appear in the original. Pagination has been applied by assigning page numbers in sequential order beginning with the first blank page of the journal in which the manuscript is written. Entries and manuscript pages are hyperlinked for reference throughout the file to ensure ease of location when displaying and searching the text. Gaskell quotes once from a poem; these lines have been encoded using the &lt;lg&gt; and &lt;l&gt; elements accordingly.</p>
<h5>Semantic Markup:</h5>
        <p>The transcription within this edition adheres to Gaskell&#39;s own spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Uncommon spellings or markings have been either noted with an editorial &lt;note> tag offering further information, or with a &lt;choice&gt; element structure that will allow readers to toggle between the original text and a supplied, normalized version. As delineated in the Editorial Policy, any deleted or unclear text has been similarly noted with &lt;unclear&gt; or &lt;gap&gt; tags. Underlined or superscript text is encoded with &lt;hi&gt;, using @rend or @superscript attributes. Additions made by Gaskell have been noted with &lt;add&gt;. Where added content is an editorial addition, I have used a &lt;supplied&gt; element.</p>
            <h5>xml:ids</h5>
            <p>The unique entities named in the diary have all been given individual xml:ids. There are nineteen individuals named within the text. The methodology used in naming these entities is as follows. Wherever possible, the xml:ids have been created to assist in human readability of the code. Assigned xml:ids begin with the name that Gaskell most commonly applies within the diary, and are followed with an underscore and the last name. In the case of married women, the first name is followed by underscores and the maiden name, followed by the married name of the individual. In this way the xml:ids are connected both to Gaskell&#39;s usual notation and to the individuals&#39; legal names in an attempt to aid scholars approaching the code from multiple angles. Where last names are not known, another descriptor is applied; this is particularly true of servants, whose surnames are in most cases unknown. For servants, the word _household has been added for additional clarity. Where multiple names are used throughout the diary for the same individual, the shortest form has been adopted.</p> 
        <p>  Xml:ids have also been provided for a number of individuals who are not named or referenced in the diary, but who played a significant role in Gaskell&#39;s life and are therefore frequently mentioned in editorial headnotes and other contextualizing information. Similar structuring has been employed to label these individuals. This xml:id naming methodology is used throughout the text. For example, Gaskell refers early on to her daughter Marianne, the primary subject of the diary, by her full first name. Later in the text, particularly after the birth of her second daughter, Meta, Gaskell begins referring to Marianne frequently by only the first two initials: MA, and this shorthand has become common usage among previous editors of the diary. Marianne Gaskell eventually married after her mother&#39;s death, becoming Marianne Holland. Thus the xml:id chosen for Marianne Gaskell Holland is MA_Gaskell_Holland. In this way, the id links Marianne both with Gaskell&#39;s shorthand for her, while still identifying both the name by which she is known throughout the time of the diary (Gaskell) and the name by which she became known to history as her mother’s heir and executor (Holland). It is hoped that these measures allow the names in the text to be as human-readable as possible, while also making the distinctions between multiple individuals with the same name as clear as possible without consulting the prosopography file. </p>
                            <p>    ISO standard date forms are used wherever possible. Full dates are given in the headings of each entry. Within the text of entries, complete or partial dates are often given, and are encoded within &lt;date&gt; elements using the @when attribute. As Gaskell often referred back to the events of previous months not recorded in the diary with these partial forms, i.e. <q>last July</q>, etc., in cases where a complete date is not written within the text, but can be logically determined through comparison to other entries, letters, or the like, the ISO date is given as completely as possible and an editorial note is encoded within the text to indicate the means through which the superadded date was supplied by the editor. In all of these cases, the encoding also includes the xml:id of the responsible editor through a @resp attribute. </p>
        <p>For people, places, and texts named within the manuscript or included in the encoded editorial notes, I have applied &lt;persName&gt;, &lt;placeName&gt; and &lt;title&gt; tags. These are all assigned @ref attributes with unique ids so that these entities are accurately tracked throughout the transcription. All people, places, and texts are additionally tracked within a personography index which is available on the site. This personography index was used to generate the list of key people, and can also be used to generate data visualizations representing Gaskell&#39;s social network. The prosopography will be an ongoing aspect of this project; the goal is to continue expanding the file and eventually link Gaskell thereby with the networks of others within her time period.</p>
