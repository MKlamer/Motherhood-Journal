                The Elizabeth Gaskell Journal: Digital Edition
            </h3>
            <p>The purpose of the Elizabeth Gaskell Journal: Digital Edition is to create an online, openly accessible edition of a single Gaskell text, Elizabeth Gaskell&#39;s manuscript diary. This new edition provides a new transcription of the text, fully encoded in TEI-XML. Images of the journal&#39;s manuscript pages have been facilitated and implemented through IIIF frameworks. Additionally, the Elizabeth Gaskell Journal - Digital Edition offers contextual information including a scholarly Introduction, annotations, editorial notes, as well as a full prosopography identifying important individuals, texts, and geographic locations referenced in the journal.</p>
            <p>The Elizabeth Gaskell Journal: Digital Edition has been undertaken as a fulfilment of dissertation requirements for the <a href="https://english.msu.edu/graduate/ph-d-program/">Doctor of Philosophy Degree</a> in the <a href="https://english.msu.edu/">English Department</a> at Michigan State University. This digital edition of the journal aims to make the text and facsimile images available to a broader audience, both scholars interested in Gaskell&#39;s life writing, and fans of her work who wish to delve more deeply into her writing beyond the novels.</p>
            <p> The Gaskell Journal has been placed by Gaskell&#39;s descendants, the holders of its copyright, in the Special Collections of the Brotherton Library in Leeds, UK. The journal is approximately 80 pages in length, written when novelist Elizabeth Gaskell&#39;s eldest surviving daughter, Marianne, was between the ages of six months (March 1835) and four years old (October 1838). I am grateful to Mrs. Sarah Prince, Gaskell&#39;s descendant and the copyright holder, for her gracious permission to reproduce the journal in this edition.
