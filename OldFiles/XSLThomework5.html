         <p><span class="number">1</span> Of nearness to her Sundered Things<br /><span class="number">2</span> The Soul has special times—<br /><span class="number">3</span> When Dimness—looks the Oddity—<br /><span class="number">4</span> Distinctness—easy—seems—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span> The Shapes we buried, dwell about,<br /><span class="number">6</span> Familiar, in the Rooms—<br /><span class="number">7</span> Untarnished by the Sepulchre,<br /><span class="number">8</span> 
            <span class="var0 var1">
               The
               Our
               <br /></span> Mouldering Playmate comes—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">9</span> In just the Jacket that he wore—<br /><span class="number">10</span> Long buttoned in the Mold<br /><span class="number">11</span> Since we—old mornings, Children—played—<br /><span class="number">12</span> Divided by a world—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">13</span> The Grave yields back her Robberies—<br /><span class="number">14</span> The Years, our pilfered Things—<br /><span class="number">15</span> Bright Knots of Apparitions<br /><span class="number">16</span> Salute us with their wings—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">17</span> As we—it were—that perished—<br /><span class="number">18</span> Themself—had just remained till we rejoin them—<br /><span class="number">19</span> And 'twas they, and not ourself<br /><span class="number">20</span> That mourned.<br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 7. (J 282: 1861/1929)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> How noteless Men and Pleiads, stand,<br /><span class="number">2</span> Until a sudden sky<br /><span class="number">3</span> Reveals the fact that One is rapt<br /><span class="number">4</span> Forever from the Eye—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span> Members of the Invisible,<br /><span class="number">6</span> Existing while we stare,<br /><span class="number">7</span> In Leagueless Opportunity,<br /><span class="number">8</span> O'ertakeless, as the Air—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">9</span> Why didn't we <span class="var0 var1 var2">
               detain Them?
               retain Them?
               detain it?
               <br /></span>
            <br /><span class="number">10</span> The Heavens with a smile,<br /><span class="number">11</span> Sweep by our disappointed Heads<br /><span class="number">12</span> <span class="var0 var1">
               Without a syllable—
               But deign no syllable
               <br /></span>
            <br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 11 (J 446: 1862/1914)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> He showed me Hights I never saw—<br /><span class="number">2</span> "Would'st Climb," —He said?<br /><span class="number">3</span> I said—"Not so"—<br /><span class="number">4</span> "With me—" He said—"With me"?<br /><span class="number">5</span> He showed me Secrets—Morning's Nest—<br /><span class="number">6</span> The Rope the Nights were put across—<br /><span class="number">7</span> "And now—"Would'st have me for a Guest"?<br /><span class="number">8</span> I could not find my "Yes".<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">9</span> And then, He brake His Life—And lo,<br /><span class="number">10</span> A Light, for me, did solemn glow,<br /><span class="number">11</span> <span class="var0 var1">
               The steadier, as my face withdrew
               The larger—as my face withdrew
               <br /></span>
            <br /><span class="number">12</span> And could I, further, "No"?<br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 8 (J 242: 1861/1945)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> When we stand on top of Things—<br /><span class="number">2</span> And like the Trees, look down—<br /><span class="number">3</span> The smoke all cleared away from it—<br /><span class="number">4</span> And Mirrors on the scene—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span> Just laying light—no soul will wink<br /><span class="number">6</span> Except it have a flaw—<br /><span class="number">7</span> The Sound ones, like the Hills
            <span class="var0 var1">
               —shall stand—
               —stand up—
               <br /></span>
            <br /><span class="number">8</span> No Lightening, <span class="var0 var1">
               scares away—
               drives away—
               <br /></span>
            <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">9</span> The Perfect, nowhere be afraid—<br /><span class="number">10</span> They bear their<br /><span class="number">11</span> <span class="var0 var1 var2">
               dauntless Heads,
               fearless—Heads,
               tranquil—Heads,
               <br /></span>
            <br /><span class="number">12</span> Where others, dare not <span class="var0 var1">
               go at Noon,
               walk at noon,
               <br /></span>
            <br /><span class="number">13</span> Protected by their deeds—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">14</span> The Stars dare shine occasionally<br /><span class="number">15</span> Upon a spotted World—<br /><span class="number">16</span> And Suns, go surer, for their Proof, <br /><span class="number">17</span> As if <span class="var0 var1">
               An Axle, held—
               A Muscle—held
               <br /></span>
            <br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 5 (J 280: 1861/1896)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, <br /><span class="number">2</span> And Mourners to and fro <br /><span class="number">3</span> Kept treading—treading—till it seemed <br /><span class="number">4</span> That Sense was breaking through— <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span> And when they were all seated, <br /><span class="number">6</span> A Service, like a Drum— <br /><span class="number">7</span> Kept beating—beating—till I thought <br /><span class="number">8</span> My Mind was going numb— <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">9</span> And then I heard them lift a Box <br /><span class="number">10</span> And creak across my Soul <br /><span class="number">11</span> With those same Boots of lead, again, <br /><span class="number">12</span> Then Space began to toll, <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">13</span> As all the Heavens were a Bell, <br /><span class="number">14</span> And Being, but an Ear, <br /><span class="number">15</span> And I, and Silence, some strange Race <br /><span class="number">16</span> Wrecked, solitary, here— <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">17</span> And then a Plank in Reason, broke, <br /><span class="number">18</span> And I dropped down, and down— <br /><span class="number">19</span> And hit a World, at every <span class="var0 var1">
               plunge,
               Crash—
               <br /></span>
            <br /><span class="number">20</span> 
            <span class="var0 var1">
               And Finished 
               And Got through—
               <br /></span>knowing—then—<br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 6 (J 281: 1861/1935)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> 'Tis so appalling—it exhilarates— <br /><span class="number">2</span> 
            <span class="var0 var1">
               So over Horror, it half Captivates—
               So over Horror, it dumb fascinates—
               <br /></span>
            <br /><span class="number">3</span> The Soul stares after it, secure— <br /><span class="number">4</span> 
            <span class="var0 var1">
               To know the worst, leaves no dread more—
               A Sepulchre, fears frost, no more—
               <br /></span>
            <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span> To scan a Ghost, is faint— <br /><span class="number">6</span> But grappling, conquers it— <br /><span class="number">7</span> How easy Torment, now— <br /><span class="number">8</span> Suspense kept sawing so— <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">9</span> The Truth, is Bald, and Cold— <br /><span class="number">10</span> But that will hold— <br /><span class="number">11</span> If any are not sure— <br /><span class="number">12</span> We show them—prayer— <br /><span class="number">13</span> But we, who know, <br /><span class="number">14</span> Stop hoping, now— <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">15</span> Looking at Death, is Dying— <br /><span class="number">16</span> Just let go the Breath— <br /><span class="number">17</span> And not the pillow at your Cheek <br /><span class="number">18</span> So Slumbereth— <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">19</span> Others, Can wrestle— <br /><span class="number">20</span> Yours, is done— <br /><span class="number">21</span> And so of Woe, bleak dreaded—come, <br /><span class="number">22</span> It sets the Fright at liberty— <br /><span class="number">23</span> And Terror's free— <br /><span class="number">24</span> Gay, Ghastly, Holiday! <br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 3 (J 279: 1861/1896)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord, <br /><span class="number">2</span> Then, I am ready to go!<br /><span class="number">3</span> Just look at the Horses—<br /><span class="number">4</span> Rapid! That will do!<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span> Put me in on the <span class="var0 var1 var2">

            <span class="var0 var1">
               And it's partly, down Hill—
               And it's many a mile—the Hills—
               <br /></span>
            <br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">9</span> But I never mind the <span class="var0 var1">
               steepest

               <br /></span>
            <br /><span class="number">10</span> And I never mind the Sea—<br /><span class="number">11</span> Held fast in Everlasting Race—<br /><span class="number">12</span> By my own Choice, and Thee—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">13</span> Goodbye to the Life I used to live—<br /><span class="number">14</span> And the World I used to know—<br /><span class="number">15</span> And kiss the Hills, for me, just once—<br /><span class="number">16</span> <span class="var0 var1 var2">
               Then—
               Now 
               Here's a keepsake for 
               <br /></span> I am ready to go!<br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 9 (J 445: 1862/1896)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> 'Twas just this time, last year, I died.<br /><span class="number">2</span>  I know I heard the Corn,<br /><span class="number">3</span> When I was carried by the Farms—<br /><span class="number">4</span> It had the Tassels on—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span> I thought how yellow it would look—<br /><span class="number">6</span> When Richard went to mill—<br /><span class="number">7</span> And then, I wanted to get out,<br /><span class="number">8</span> But something held my will.<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">9</span> I thought just how red—Apples wedged<br /><span class="number">10</span> The Stubble's joints between—<br /><span class="number">11</span> And carts stooping round the fields<br /><span class="number">12</span> To take the Pumpkins in—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">13</span> I wondered which would miss me, least,<br /><span class="number">14</span> And when Thanksgiving, came,<br /><span class="number">15</span> If father'd multiply the plates—<br /><span class="number">16</span> To make an even Sum—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">17</span> And would it blur the Christmas glee<br /><span class="number">18</span> My Stocking hand too high<br /><span class="number">19</span> For any Santa Claus to reach<br /><span class="number">20</span> The Altitude of me—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">21</span> But this sort, grieved myself,<br /><span class="number">22</span> And so, I thought the other way,<br /><span class="number">23</span> And just this time, some perfect year—<br /><span class="number">24</span> Themself, should come to me—<br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 4 (J 241: 1861/1890)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> I like a look of Agony,<br /><span class="number">2</span> Because I know it's true—<br /><span class="number">3</span> Men do not sham Convulsion,<br /><span class="number">4</span> Nor simulate a Throe—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span>

               Death comes

            <br /><span class="number">6</span> The Eyes glaze once—and—that is Death—<br /><span class="number">7</span> Impossible to feign<br /><span class="number">8</span> The Beads upon the Forehead<br /><span class="number">9</span> By homely Anguish strung.<br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 1 (J 327: 1862/1891)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> Before I got my eye put out—<br /><span class="number">2</span> I liked as well to see<br /><span class="number">3</span> As other Creatures, that have Eyes—<br /><span class="number">4</span> And know no other way—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span> But were it told to me, Today,<br /><span class="number">6</span> That I might have the Sky<br /><span class="number">7</span> For mine, I tell you that my Heart<br /><span class="number">8</span> Would split, for size of me—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">9</span> The Meadows—mine—<br /><span class="number">10</span> The Mountains—mine— <br /><span class="number">11</span> All Forests—Stintless Stars—<br /><span class="number">12</span> As much of noon, as I could take—<br /><span class="number">13</span> Between my finite Eyes—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">14</span> The Motions of the Dipping Birds—<br /><span class="number">15</span> The <span class="var0 var1">
               Lightning's jointed Road—
               Morning's Amber Road—
               <br /></span>
            <br /><span class="number">16</span> For mine—to look at when I liked <br /><span class="number">17</span> The news would strike me dead—<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">18</span> So safer—guess—with just my soul<br /><span class="number">19</span> Upon the window pane<br /><span class="number">20</span> Where other Creatures put their Eyes<br /><span class="number">21</span> Incautious of the Sun—<br /></p>
         <h2>Poem 10 (J 608: 1862/1890)</h2>
         <p><span class="number">1</span> Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?<br /><span class="number">2</span> Not Death—for who is He?<br /><span class="number">3</span> The Porter of my father's Lodge<br /><span class="number">4</span> As much abasheth me!<br /></p>
         <p><span class="number">5</span> Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear thing<br /><span class="number">6</span> That comprehendeth me<br /><span class="number">7</span> In one or <span class="var0 var1">
