                <p>To my dear little Marianne I shall "dedicate"<lb/> this book, which, if I should
                    not live to give<lb/> it her myself, will I trust be reserved for her<lb/> as a
                    token of her mother's love, and extreme<lb/> anxiety in the formation of her
                    little<lb/> daughter's character. If that little daughter<lb/> should in time
                    become a mother herself,<lb/> she may take an interest in the experience<lb/> of
                    another; and at any rate she will<lb/> perhaps like to become acquainted with
                    her character in <choice><sic>it's</sic><reg>its</reg></choice> earliest form.
                    I<lb/> wish that (if ever she sees this) I could<lb/> give her the slightest
                    idea of the love<lb/> and the hope that is bound up in<lb/> her. The love which

                    is also very firm<lb/> in her own little way occasionally; what<lb/> I suppose
                    is obstinacy really, only that<lb/> is so hard a word to apply to one so<lb/>
                    dear. But in general she is so good<lb/> that I feel as if I could hardly

                <p><persName ref="#Marianne_Holland">Marianne</persName> is now becoming every
                    day<lb/> more and more interesting. She looks at<lb/> and tries to take hold of
                    every thing. She<lb/> has pretty good ideas of distance and does<lb/> not try to
                    catch sunbeams now, as she<lb/><pb n="4"/> did two months ago. Her sense of
                    sight<lb/> is much improved lately in seeing objects<lb/> at a distance, and
                    distinguishing them.<lb/> For instance I had her in my arms
                    today<!-- necessary to code the slight diagonal downward on the "day" here?--><lb/>
                    in the drawing room, and her <persName ref="#William_Gaskell"
                    >Papa</persName><lb/> was going out of the gate; and she
                    evi<!--split word--><lb/>=dently knows him; smiled and kicked.<lb/> She begins
                    to show a decided preference<lb/> to those she likes; she puts out her
                    little<lb/> arms to come to me, and would I<lb/> am sure, do so to her <persName
                        ref="#William_Gaskell">Papa</persName>. She catches<lb/> the expression of a
                    countenance to which she is accustomed directly;<lb/> when we laugh, she laughs;
                    and when<lb/> I look attentive to <persName ref="#William_Gaskell"
                        >William</persName><!--Create xml:id for William Gaskell-->'s reading,<lb/>
                    it is quite ridiculous to see her little face of gravity, and earnestness, as
                    if<lb/> she understood every word. I try always<lb/> to let her look at any
                    thing which at<!--split word--><lb/>tracts her notice as long as she
                        <unclear>will</unclear><lb/><pb n="5"/> and when I see her looking very
                    intently<lb/> at <choice><sic>any thing</sic><reg>anything</reg></choice>, I
                    take her to it, and let<lb/> her exercise all her senses upon
                    it-<!-- place spaces around dashes or leave words connected?-->even<lb/> to
                    tasting, if I am sure it can do her<lb/> no harm. My object is to give her
                    a<lb/> habit of fixing her attention.<lb/></p>
                <p>She takes great delight in motion just<lb/> at present; dancing, jumping,
                    shutting<lb/> and opening the hand pleases her very
                    much:<!-- long gap. Not sure whether to code this as a paragraph break or an empty space-->
                    I had no idea children<lb/> at her age, made such continued<lb/> noises; she
                    shouts, and murmurs, and<lb/> talks in her way, just like
                    conversa=<lb/><!--split word--> tion, varying her tones &amp;c. I wish<lb/> we
                    could know what is passing<lb/> in her little mind. She likes
                    any<lb/><!--split word-->=thing like singing, but seems afraid<lb/> of the
                    piano; today she even began<lb/> to cray, when I began to play.<lb/><pb n="6"
                    /></p>
                <p>In general, I think she is remarkably<lb/> free from fear or shyness of any
                    sort.<lb/> She goes to <choice><sic>any one</sic><reg>anyone</reg></choice> who
                    will take her,<lb/> staring at strangers to be sure, and being<lb/> very grave
                    while they are in the room,<lb/> but not crying, or clinging to me. I am<lb/>
                    very glad of this, as though is is very<lb/> flttering and endearing to me,
                    yet<lb/> I should be sorry if she were to get the<lb/> habit of refusing to go
                    to others.<lb/></p>
                <p>Then as to her "bodily" qualifications.<lb/> She has had two teeth cut with very
                    little<lb/> trouble; but I believe the worst are<lb/> to come. She is very
                    strong in her<lb/> limbs, though because she is so fat, we<lb/> do not let her
                    use her <choice><sic>ancles</sic><reg>ankles</reg></choice> at all,<lb/> and I
                    hope she will be rather late in<lb/> walking that her little legs may be<lb/>
                    very firm. I shall find it difficult to<lb/> damp the energies of the servants
                    in<lb/> this respect, but I intend that she shall<lb/> teach herself to walk,

                    from hands &amp;c. She lies down on the<lb/> floor a good deal, and kicks about;
                    a<lb/> practice I began very early, and which<lb/> has done her a great deal of
                    good.<lb/></p>
                <p>She goes to bed <hi rend="underline">awake</hi>; another practice<lb/> I began
                    early, and which is so comfort<lb/><!--split word-->=able I wonder it is not
                    more generally<lb/> adopted. Once or twice we have had<lb/> grand cryings, which
                    have been very<lb/> very distressing to me; but when I<lb/> have convinced
                    myself that she is not<lb/> in pain, is perfectly well, and that she<lb/> is
                    only wanting to be taken
                    up<!-- possibly a dash between: taken-up. Consult a better image--> I have<lb/>
                    been quite firm, though I have some=<lb/>=times<!--split word--> cried almost as

                    as=<lb/><!--split word-->=leep (except in extreme cases) and as<lb/> she is put
                    to bed at a regular time<lb/> (6 o'clock) she generally gets very sleepy<lb/><pb
                        n="8"/> while being undressed. While the
                    un=<lb/><!--split word-->=dre<!-- long s -->ssing is going on, I never like
                    her<lb/> to be talked to, played with, or excited<lb/> yet sometimes she is so
                    very playful<lb/> when she ought to be put down, that<lb/> a turn or two up and
                    down the room<lb/> is required to soothe her, still putting<lb/> her down awake.
                    Sometimes she will<lb/> cry a little, and when I turn her over<lb/> in her cot
                    she fancies she is going<lb/> to be taken up and is still in a moment<lb/>
                    making the peculiar little triumphing<lb/> noise she always does when she
                    is<lb/> pleased.<lb/></p>
                <p>Crying has been a great difficulty<lb/> with me. Books do so differ. One
                    says<lb/> "Do not let them have <choice><sic>any

                    it<lb/> quite as I ought, I still think it a<lb/> good one. We must consider
                    that a<lb/> cry is a child's only language for<lb/> expressing its wants. It is
                    its little way<lb/> of saying, "I am hungry, I am very<lb/> cold," and <hi

                <p>It seems a very long time since I have<lb/> written anything about my little

                <p>In a few days she will be eleven months<lb/> old; and in sme things I suppose she
                    is<lb/> rather backward; in walking and talking<lb/> for instance. <hi

                    fancy. She can<lb/> stand pretty steadily, taking hold of

                    down. But as I am not very<lb/> anxious for her to walk or talk earlier<lb/><pb

                    allow her to<lb/> take her own way.<lb/></p>
                <p>She has various little accomplishments<lb/> of her own, clapping hands,
                    shaking<lb/> hands, which are very pretty, though I<lb/> sometimes fear we
