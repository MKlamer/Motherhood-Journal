                           <p>Elizabeth Gaskell's journal is contained in a notebook, approximately
                              4 1/2 by 7 inches, bound with marbled <material>boards</material> with
                              a spine and corners in <material>calf</material>. The edges of the
                              leaves are also marbled. The paper within the notebook has been
                              gathered throughout in twelves, although the first gathering has only
                              six leaves. As noted by <ref>Anita Wilson and J.A.V. Chapple</ref>,
                              some gatherings contain the watermark <watermark>'Harris

                        <p>The journal appears to be all written with a single hand. Gaskell's
                           handwriting is largely clear and easily legible. She uses the ampersand
                           and dashes frequently throughout the text to string phrases together. The
                           entries have lengthy paragraphs that occasionally span multiple pages,
                           and occasionally an entry has only two paragraphs. Gaskell occasionally
                           leaves a long, word-length space inline within the text; in most cases
                           these seem to serve semantically as paragraph breaks, though this is not
                           always the case. Gaskell also uses the long s character for many words
                           containing a medial double s, although this too, is not consistently used
                           throughout the journal. Many letters have individual flourishing strokes;
                           as an example, Gaskell begins all lowercase 'm' and 'p' characters with
                           an upward looping stroke. The loops on her capital 'B' characters appear
                           to slide outward to the side, resembling a capital 'M'. She nearly always
                           provides a dot for 'i' characters but frequently neglects crossing 't'
                           characters, particularly when they occur mid-word. When words end with
                           'll', the first 'l' character loops significantly higher than the second,
                           appearing similar to 'le'. </p>

            <p>The Gaskell Journal Digital Edition is an online, openly accessible edition of a
               single Gaskell text, Elizabeth Gaskell’s manuscript journal, offering an annotated
               and newly transcribed text with high-quality digital images of the manuscript pages.
               This new edition provides a fully-encoded version of the text, allowing richer
               analysis of the content of the journal. Additionally, the Elizabeth Gaskell Journal -
               Digital Edition includes editorial headnotes contextualizing the journal as a text
               predominantly focused on motherhood, and a full prosopography identifying important
               individuals, texts, and geographic locations that created the context within which
               Gaskell wrote. The Gaskell Journal Digital Edition simultaneously works as an
               intervention in dissertation practice, through modeling a digital dissertation
               deliverable which mobilizes current practices in textual encoding to create an online
               edition of the manuscript capitalizing on available technologies. The core of the
               edition is a new transcription of the journal, fully encoded in TEI-XML. Images of
               the journal pages have been facilitated and implemented through IIIF frameworks. This
               digital edition also offers contextual information including a scholarly
               Introduction, annotations, and editorial notes, as well as supplemental materials.
               The digital edition of the journal makes the text and facsimile images available to a
               broader audience, both scholars interested in Gaskell’s life writing, and fans of her
               work who wish to delve more deeply into her writing beyond the novels. </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Repository: The files for the digital edition are stored and version-controlled
               through a GitHub repository (https://github.com/MKlamer/Motherhood-Journal). In
               addition to tracking the project and maintaining a record of changes through the Git
               version-control system, the GitHub repository simultaneously allows a venue for the
               online publication of the code underlying the project, participating in a movement
               that enables the free sharing and remixing of encoding structures and examples to
               enrich further online projects and data models. </p>
            <p>Editing Policy: The copy-text for this journal transcription is the original
               manuscript, currently held in the Special Collections of the Brotherton Library,
               Leeds UK. The transcription was hand-encoded from photographic images of the
               manuscript obtained through the gracious generosity of Kristen Mapes. Gaskell’s
               chirography is remarkably clear and quite consistent, however in the event of unclear
               characters, consultation was supplemented by comparison with the high-quality IIIF
               images made available through the Brotherton Special Collections site, and
               additionally through in-person scrutiny of the manuscript during a research trip to
               the UK made in the summer of 2018. Where doubt remained, I have adhered to a policy
               of submitting to the wisdom of previous editors, and have found no reason in such
               cases to substantially change the transcription offered in these editions. In nearly
               every case, this new edition adheres to the faithful transcriptions made in 1996 by
               Anita Wilson and J.A.V. Chapple and in 2006 by Joanne Shattock. </p>
            <p> In two regards this transcription does differ markedly from the previous editions:
               in the choice to retain Gaskell’s own terminology of <q>journal</q>, and in my
               decision to preserve Gaskell’s use of underlining throughout the manuscript, in
               contrast to the previous editors’ policy of rendering all underlined text in italics.
               The decision to return to Gaskell’s own use of the term <q>journal</q>, which has
               been made in contradistinction to all previous published editions of the text, is
               intended first and foremost to adhere as much as possible to Gaskell’s own textual
               choices. This aim to reproduce the manuscript completely, as far as possible,
               complete with its own idiosyncracies, has been the central driving principle of this
               edition. The digital medium makes possible heretofore impossible levels of comparison
               between the manuscript pages and transcriptions of the journal, and it is hoped that
               in adhering as much as possible to Gaskell’s own chirographical and grammatical
               choices, the reader will find rich avenues for new inquiry. The choice to maintain
               Gaskell’s underlining is twofold: first, it preserves the character and authenticity
               of Gaskell’s original manuscript; second, it provides greater clarity for reader
               comparison between the transcription and the manuscript images which are offered for
               the first time in this digital edition. </p>
            <p>The editing policy has been to preserve Gaskell’s own spelling and punctuation as it
               exists in the manuscript. Markup has been applied as follows:</p>
            <ab>Underlining: I have retained Gaskell’s use of underlining throughout the manuscript
               using the &lt;hi&gt; element.</ab>
            <ab>Supplied / Reg: Gaskell’s idiosyncratic spellings and missing punctuation have been
               marked using a structure of choice, sic, and reg elements, or unclear, reason and
               supplied elements.</ab>
            <ab> Long S: Gaskell’s long s characters have been encoded using the escape character ſ
               wrapped in a choice, sic and reg structure.</ab>
            <ab>Line Breaks: Gaskell inserts an equal sign on both sides of the break. All new lines
               have been denoted in the markup with the use of a line beginning element: &lt;lb/&gt;
               with the additional @break attribute, with a value of “no,”</ab>
            <ab>Unclear and Gap: Obscure text has been marked with an unclear element, and the
               single cut away section is marked by a gap element.</ab>
            <p> Structural Markup: The journal has been encoded as a single XML-TEI file. Journal
               entries, together with their respective headnotes, are enclosed within a div element
               of type <q>journal</q>. Each individual journal entry and headnote is enclosed in an
               individual div element within these larger divs. </p>

         </editorialDecl>
         <refsDecl>
            <p>The unique entities named in the diary have all been given individual xml:ids. There
               are nineteen individuals named within the text. The methodology used in naming these
               entities is as follows. Wherever possible, the xml:ids have been created to assist in
               human readability of the code. Assigned xml:ids begin with the name that Gaskell most
               commonly applies within the diary, and are followed with an underscore and the last
               name. In the case of married women, the first name is followed by underscores and the
               maiden name, followed by the married name of the individual. In this way the xml:ids
               are connected both to Gaskell’s usual notation and to the individuals’ legal names in
               an attempt to aid scholars approaching the code from multiple angles. Where last
               names are not known, another descriptor is applied; this is particularly true of
               servants, whose surnames are in most cases unknown. For servants, the word _household
               has been added for additional clarity. Where multiple names are used throughout the
               diary for the same individual, the shortest form has been adopted. Xml:ids have also
               been provided for a number of individuals who are not named or referenced in the
               diary, but who played a significant role in Gaskell’s life and are therefore
               frequently mentioned in editorial headnotes and other contextualizing information.
               Similar structuring has been employed to label these individuals. </p>

               <head>Length of Entry: 10 handwritten pages</head>
               <p>In this first entry, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> devotes a lengthy portion of her narrative (3 full pages)
                  to writing about her own maternal choices - in this case, particularly her plans
                  for handling common parenting concerns, including bedtimes, how to respond to
                  cries and demands, and developmental milestones like learning to walk. This keen
                  awareness of motherhood is marked by self-doubt and an equally pronounced sense of
                  self-judgment stemming from Victorian assumptions about maternal duty. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> uses the diary as a means
                  to check her own maternal behaviors, writing: <quote>though I keep laying down
                     rules, I fear I have not sufficiently attended to them, though I hope I have
                     been conscientious hitherto in discharging my duty to her.</quote> These rules
                  draw in part on educational treatises of the day; in this entry she cites a text
                  by the French authoress <persName ref="#Mme_DeSaussure">Madame Necker
                     DeSaussure</persName>. <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>’s conclusions, however, are more rigid for herself than for
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>. While insisting that
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> not be pressured into
                  walking or learning anything before she is ready, <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> repeatedly reinforces her
                  commitment to her own duty to raise <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> according to strict principles, such as telling her
                  nothing but the absolute truth and selflessly placing her own needs after those of
                  her daughter.</p>
               <p>The dedication itself, where <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> hopes the diary <quote>will be reserved for [<persName
                        ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>] as a token of her mother’s
                     love and extreme anxiety in the formation of her little daughter’s
                     character,</quote> demonstrates even at the outset the depth of introspection
                  that <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> associates
                  with the diary form, and with this manuscript in particular. Although undertaken
                  to record <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                     <quote>character in it’s earliest form</quote>, the diary is ostensibly also a
                  record of Gaskell’s own maternal anxieties, and in being so, it is also suggests
                  her fears of maternal mortality, which echo as an underlying theme throughout the
                  diary, both in her repeated fears of loss and in her inclusion of prayers for her
                  daughters’ safety. The brief <quote>God bless her</quote> that closes this entry
                  marks a tendency to conclude her entries with prayers for her daughters’ health
                  and safety that continues throughout the diary. At all times, the relationship
                  between mother and daughters is colored by a pervasive fear of death. </p>
               <p><persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s first entry is
                  slightly over ten handwritten pages, and was likely written on the same date as
                  the dedication; the handwriting is similar in size, saturation and ink color.
                     <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> appears to have
                  often written in the evenings when her children were in bed; this and several
                  other entries indicate <quote>evening</quote> in the dateline. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> writes in this entry
                  about <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s bedtime routine;
                  she was laid down awake, at 6pm every evening, and since the entry concludes with
                  a comment about listening to <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s restful breathing during the time of writing, it seems
                  likely that this entry was written sometime after 6 pm.</p>

               <p><lb/>Then as to her <q>bodily</q> qualifications. <lb/>She has had two teeth cut
                  with very little <lb/>trouble; but I believe the worst are <lb/>to come. She is

                     1833</date>; at the time of this entry it had been just over two years since
                     this loss.</note> The fear is quite poignant for <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>, and she copies a portion
                  of a poem by <persName ref="#Caroline_Bowles_Southey">Caroline Bowles</persName>,
                     <quote>To A Dying Infant</quote>, which was frequently used as a Victorian
                  epitaph. The entry includes a prayer of thankfulness that <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> was spared, which falls in this
                  case mid-entry. </p>
               <p>This is the only entry in the diary to have a significant portion of the text
                  missing. The top third of the second page has been removed, presumably cut because
                  the edge of the remaining page is smooth. The second page [recto] shows marks
                  where a small 2-3 fragment of the page is still attached to the binding of the
                  codex. Given the typical spacing of <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>’s handwritten lines, her habit of noting words broken
                  across the lines with equal signs, and the number and placement of the extant
                  marks on the fragment, we can assume that approximately six lines of text are
                  missing on the recto side of the page, and 5-6 lines on the verso. We can surmise
                  that the all of the text on the surrounding pages, together with the section that
                  remains from the lower section of the page, are all fragments of the second diary
                  entry, and that the lost sections did not include the start or endpoint of another
                  diary entry. This is clear because the following (third) entry, dated <date
                     when="1835-10-04">October fourth 1835</date>, begins, <quote>I see it is

               <p><persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> continues
                  describing <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s development
                  and her own convictions about parenting in this entry. According to the
                  descriptions given here, the Gaskells were still calling <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>
                  <quote>baby</quote>. She would be an only child until 1837. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> both celebrates behaviors
                  that she interprets as the beginning of self-government, while also commenting at
                  length on <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s recovery from
                  an illness that is recounted in the previous entry. She mentions throughout
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s personality- that she
                  recognizes family, will share food, rarely cries, etc., and mentions her growing
                  vocabulary and general observation and attentiveness. Throughout the entry, in
                  addition to learning more about <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> - she still does not walk, and is still living on
                  thickened broth, which <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> believes has improved her health - we continue to learn
                  more about <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s
                  maternal instincts. She is deeply self-critical and sets high standards for
                  herself. In the opening of the entry, she criticizes herself for not having
                  written sooner, although it has been only two months since the previous entry. She
                  also claims that she <quote>ought not</quote> to be negligent in any regard toward
                  her daughter, including in this instance, in writing about her in the journal. Of
                  particular note in this entry is the penultimate sentence, in which <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> writes, <quote>I feel
                     weak &amp; exhausted with writing, or I had meant to write more.</quote> This
                  admission, in addition to underscoring the duty <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> feels to keep the diary,
                  foregrounds the weight which maternal writing held for <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>. This writing is not
                  merely record keeping or reflection; it is a deeply personal, emotionally invested
                  act which requires energy of the author. Even paper motherhood is taxing. The
                  entry, as many do, ends with a prayer, asking a blessing upon <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, and help for <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> as she fulfils her sense
                  of duty.</p>

                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, it is the last one in
                  which she has only one child. By the date of the following entry, <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> was already expecting her
                  second daughter, <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Margaret Emily (called Meta)
                  </persName>. Six of the eleven journal entries, including this one, are written on
                  Sundays, usually in the evenings. <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> opens this entry with a recollection of the sermon text,
                  drawn from the Christmas narrative in <bibl ref="#Bible">Luke</bibl>, which
                  mentions a mother treasuring memory of her son <note>See textual note regarding
                     the placement of this reading in February</note>. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> connects the text with
                  her own maternal practice of actively seeking to remember her children, and
                  specifically credits her diary-keeping practice: <quote>I sometimes think I may
                     find this little journal a great help in recalling the memory of my darling
                     child if we should lose her.</quote></p>
               <p>After this rather melancholy opening, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> goes on to record <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s development according to her custom: first physical
                  development, and then social and emotional. Between the lines of the text,
                  however, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> has
                  inscribed another record, the record of her own re-reading of the journal. Beyond
                  merely suggesting that rereading the journal <quote>would</quote> be helpful in
                  the instance of <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s death,
                  Gaskell actually rereads her diary while she is living, as indicated by the
                  sentence, <quote>I see I have generally begun my journal with describing the
                     bodily progress she has made, and I will keep to the proper order of
                     things.</quote> Thus, even in writing the diary itself, <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> is prescribing and
                  following maternal rules. The diary too, must follow a carefully planned form in
                  order to be successful. It must be <quote>proper</quote>.</p>
               <p><persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> is on the whole
                  pleased with <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s development
                  here, claiming that her personality promises to be affectionate and pleasant,
                  although she bemoans her disobedience. The remaining diary entry emphasizes
                  obedience on two levels: <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                  disobedience in trying to traverse a gap between two chairs, resulting in a fall,
                  and <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s own
                  disobedience to her perceived higher calling as a mother. <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> ends this entry with a
                  rather lengthy prayer element, in which she bemoans the <quote>sin that doth so
                     easily beset me,</quote> anger, as the rest of the entry would suggest, and
                  prays for help to control herself, particularly for her daughter. She “intends”
                  herself to be patient, just as she <quote>intends</quote>
                  <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> to be independent, and as
                  in much of the journal, she takes the responsibility herself, though calling on a
                  higher power to support her goals. </p>

                     quoting from Luke 2:19. The reference is to Mary, the mother of Jesus; Luke 2
                     contains the most widely referenced Nativity account. Although Christmas is in
                     December, the reading may have appeared in February in conjunction with
                     Candlemas, which occurs on February 2nd. Candlemas is a Feast of the
                     Purification of Mary and also the Presentation of Jesus in the temple (40 days
                     following the birth of a son, the child was brought to the temple and a
                     sacrifice made for purification of the mother). Interestingly, nearly all
                     translations of this text refer to Mary by name, but Gaskell chooses here the
                     term “mother” instead, emphasizing the relationship. She is relating to Mary in
                     her role.</note> Oh! how very, very <lb/>true it is - and I sometimes think I
                  may <lb/>find this little

                  help in <lb/>recalling the memory of my darling child, <lb/>if we should lose
                     her.<note resp="#mjk">Gaskell returns to the theme with which she began the
                     diary, the fear that death will separate her from her daughter. She knew this
                     firsthand, having lost her first daughter due to stillbirth fourteen months
                     before Marianne’s birth. This draws in part from the sermon text earlier in the
                     entry, wherein Mary is treasuring memories of Christ’s childhood in the way
                     that a mother collects memories and experiences, and simultaneously expects it.
                     In the Christmas narratives, one of the gifts of the Magi was myrrh, a
                     fragrance used to annoint the dead, thus prefiguring His death. </note></p>

                     >Gaskell</persName>’s belief that <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s behavior is heavily dependent upon and affected by her
                  physiological status. She follows her established pattern, beginning with a
                  description of <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s physical
                  development, followed by her intellectual and moral development. The entry’s
                  physical description surrounds <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s learning to walk, which she did at the late age of 22
                  months old. According to <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>, upon the advice of <persName ref="#Richard_Deane">Dr.

                  was kept from being put on her feet during a summer visit in 1836, when she would
                  have been nearly 21 months old. Following a “violent attack” which the Gaskells
                  treated with a warm bath and a dose of castor oil, <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> cut her eye teeth, and
                  subsequently <quote>began almost suddenly to walk.</quote> The narrative of this
                  milestone step exemplifies <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>’s attitudes toward development throughout the diary: while
                  eager to see <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                  achievements, <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>
                  insists on letting her daughters develop at their own pace, and concerns herself
                  primarily with helping <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> to
                  develop habits of perseverance and patience, rather than insisting on her gaining
                  any particular knowledge or skills.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the diary entry emphasizes <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>’s intellectual and moral development; she enjoys stories
                  and chatters often, but <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName>, as with walking, intends to wait on formal instruction
                  until <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> is over 3 years old.
                  She is pleased with her daughter’s awareness of right and wrong, commenting that
                     <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> often talks to herself
                  about being a <quote>dood dirl</quote> [good girl], and even recording a situation
                  in which she observed an adult engaged in something wrong and told her mother
                  about it. Although she shows evident pleasure in <persName

                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> again closes the entry
                  with anxious maternal worries. Recalling the unexpected death of an acquaintance’s
                  only child, she concludes with the observation of <quote>how very precious may the

                  for her strength and resignation in the face of possible loss. </p>

                     ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> was a *widowed woman who raised
                     <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> after her
                     <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Holland_Stevenson">mother</persName>’s death when she
                  was only thirteen months old. Shortly following the birth of <persName

                     Lumb</persName> suffered a stroke that marked the beginning of her final
                  illness. <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> had been staying
                  with her at the time, during her <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >mother</persName>’s confinement, and both <persName

                     <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> traveled to be with <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> and <persName
                     ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> early in March until her death
                  in May. These events, <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>’s birth and
                     <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>’s death, are alluded
                  to by <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> early in the
                  entry, when she writes that “sad excuses” in some part account for the year-long
                  lapse between this diary entry and the one that preceded it. </p>
               <p>Much of the entry is told looking back on the months that have passed between the
                  entries, during which time <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> was born,
                  and <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> passed away. The
                  events were closely connected, in fact; <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> had gone to stay with <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb"
                     >Aunt Lumb</persName> had a paralytic stroke, and <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> traveled to <placeName

                     ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> and a servant, Betsy, and remained there in
                  rented rooms with both girls for nearly two months until <persName
                     ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>’s death on May 1st. A letter,
                  dated <date when="1837-03-18">18 March 1837</date>, recounts <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s experience of <persName
                     ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>’s illness. There is also a
                  second letter, written to <persName ref="#Holbrook_Gaskell">Holbrook
                     Gaskell</persName>, tentatively dated in 1837 as <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> is the only child mentioned; part
                  of the letter is missing. The letter details plans for the possibility of
                  negotiating a new servant.</p>
               <p>The diary entry looks back on these events and comments tenderly on <persName
                     ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName>’s care of both <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> and <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>, and recounts <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>’s careful management of
                  the situation with <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, who
                  was not told that <persName ref="#Hannah_Holland_Lumb">Aunt Lumb</persName> had
                  died. The later part of the entry discusses the differences between the two
                  sisters, commenting that <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>, already
                  ten months old, is livelier and physically developing earlier than <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, crawling “famously”. <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>, to <persName

                  “acute” conscience, and is becoming “useful and independent,” often willing to
                  share with her sister and generally obedient and cheerful. <persName
                     ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName>, however, is <quote>saucy</quote>,
                     <quote>clever</quote>, and <quote>not so gentle</quote> as her elder
                  sister.</p>

                     1837</date>, however, and the entirety of the diary continues in chronological

                     >Gaskell</persName>’s maternal responsibility surrounding the education of her

                  the country must have been watching closely as they prepared for rule under a

                     >Gaskell</persName>’s indecisiveness or doubt in maternal choices, and she uses
                  the journal to weigh both sides of the decision. On one hand, she worries,

                  school from the other children that she would not wish her to know, and may care

                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> reasons, school will give
                  her the opportunity to learn obedience and perseverance, which are characteristics

                  not concerned with <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                  learning much in the school, so much as her developing the necessary habits that
                  will underly her learning later. </p>

               <p>The ninth entry draws comparisons between the two daughters, and is particularly
                  concerned with health, and again, with the possibility of loss. <persName

                  recent <quote>attack of croup,</quote> which likely occurred only days after the
                  previous entry. This illness was deeply significant for <persName
                     ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName>; it forms the primary
                  substance of a contemporaneous letter, dated <date when="1838-03-30">March 30,
                     1838</date> to <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Gaskell_Holland">Eliza (Aunt Lizzy)

                     >Gaskell</persName>’s most frequent early correspondents. Gaskell also comments
                  in both sources (diary and letter) about the death of <persName

                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName> and died four days later.

               <p><persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell">Gaskell</persName> continues with a
                  description of <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>’s
                  development, much like those earlier in the diary for <persName
                     ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland">Marianne</persName>. <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell"
                     >Meta</persName> is independent, crawling and pulling herself up, playing and
                  making noise. She is more fretful than <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName>, and <persName ref="#Elizabeth_Stevenson_Gaskell"
                     >Gaskell</persName> reasserts her former <quote>rules,</quote> although in
                  Meta’s case, she fears that the servants are spoiling her rather than attending to
                  them. <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell">Meta</persName> eagerly wants what her sister
                  has, and according to the entry, eats nearly everything she is given as well. The
                  entry ends with a brief comment on the sisters’ relationship, this time worrying
                  that although they get along well, <persName ref="#MA_Gaskell_Holland"
                     >Marianne</persName> on occasion hurts <persName ref="#Meta_Gaskell"
                     >Meta</persName> knowingly. The entry closes with another prayer for their
                  preservation, and a dash, perhaps indicating a hurried closing. </p>
